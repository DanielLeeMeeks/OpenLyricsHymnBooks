		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
in a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,
and drives away his fear.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>It makes the wounded spirit whole,
and calms the troubled breast;
'tis manna to the hungry soul,
and to the weary rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Dear Name! the Rock on which I build,
my Shield and Hiding Place,
my never-failing Treas'ry filled
with boundless stores of grace!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>By Thee my pray'rs acceptance gain,
although with sin defiled;
Satan accuses me in vain,
and I am owned a child.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Jesus! my Shepherd, Husband, Friend,
my Prophet, Priest, and King;
my Lord, my Life, my Way, my End,
accept the praise I bring.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Weak is the effort of my heart,
and cold my warmest thought;
but when I see Thee as Thou art,
I'll praise Thee as I ought!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>Till then I would Thy love proclaim
with ev'ry fleeting breath;
and may the music of Thy name
refresh me soul in death.</lines>
		</verse>
