		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus lives, and so shall I;
Death, thy sting is gone forever!
He who deigned for me to die
lives, the bands of death to sever.
He shall raise me with the just:
Jesus is my Hope and Trust.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus lives, and reigns supreme,
and, His kingdom still remaining,
I shall also be with Him,
ever living, ever reigning.
God has promised: be it must:
Jesus is my Hope and Trust.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Jesus lives, and God extends
grace to each returning sinner;
rebels He receives as friends
and exalts to highest honor.
God is True as He is Just;
Jesus is my Hope and Trust.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Jesus lives, and by His grace,
vict'ry o'er my passions giving,
I will cleanse my heart and ways,
ever to His glory living.
Me He raises from the dust;
Jesus is my Hope and Trust.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Jesus lives! I know full well
nought from Him my heart can sever,
life nor death nor pow'rs of hell,
joy nor grief, henceforth forever.
None of all His saints is lost;
Jesus is my Hope and Trust.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Jesus lives, and death is now
but my entrance into glory.
Courage, then, my soul, for thou
hast a crown of life before thee;
thou shalt find thy hopes were just;
Jesus is the Christian's Trust.</lines>
		</verse>
