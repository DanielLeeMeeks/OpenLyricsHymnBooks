		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Angels, from the realms of glory,
wing your flight o'er all the earth;
ye, who sang creation's story,
now proclaim Messiah's birth:
come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing;
yonder shines the infant Light:
come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Sages, leave your contemplations;
brighter visions beam afar;
seek the great Desire of nations;
ye have seen His natal star:
come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Saints before the altar bending,
watching long in hope and fear,
suddenly the Lord, descending,
in His temple shall appear:
come and worship, come and worship,
worship Christ, the newborn King!</lines>
		</verse>
