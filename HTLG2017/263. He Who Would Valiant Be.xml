		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Who would valiant be 'against all disaster,
let him in constancy follow the Master.
There's no discouragement shall make him once relent
his first avowed intent to be a pilgrim.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Who so beset him round with dismal stories,
do but themselves confound--his strength the more is.
No foes shall stay his might, though he with giants fight;
he will make good his right to be a pilgrim.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Since, Lord, Thou dost defend us with Thy Spirit
we know we at the end shall life inherit.
Then, fancies, flee away! I'll fear not what men say,
I'll labor night and day to be a pilgrim.</lines>
		</verse>
