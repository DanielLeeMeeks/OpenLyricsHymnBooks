		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come, Thou Fount of ev'ry blessing,
tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
streams of mercy, never ceasing,
call for songs of loudest praise.
Teach me some melodious sonnet,
sung by flaming tongues above.
Praise the mount--I'm fixed upon it-
mount of God's unchanging love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Here I find my Ebenezer;
hither by Thy help I've come;
and I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
safely to arrive at home.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
wand'ring from the fold of God;
He, to rescue me from danger,
interposed His precious blood.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Oh, to grace how great a debtor
daily I'm constrained to be!
Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
bind my wand'ring heart to Thee;
prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
prone to leave the God I love;
here's my heart, O take and seal it;
seal it for Thy courts above.</lines>
		</verse>
