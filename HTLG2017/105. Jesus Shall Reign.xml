	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
does its successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
till moons shall wax and wane no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>To Him shall endless pray'r be made,
and endless praises crown his Head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
with ev'ry morning sacrifice.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>People and realms of ev'ry tongue
dwell on His love with sweetest song,
and infant voices shall proclaim
their early blessings on His name.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Blessings abound where'er He reigns;
the pris'ners leap to lose their chains,
the weary find eternal rest,
and all who suffer want are blessed.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Let ev'ry creature rise and bring
their grateful honors to our King.
Angels descend with songs again,
and earth repeat the loud "Amen!"</lines>
		</verse>
