		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I lay my sins on Jesus,
the spotless Lamb of God;
He bears them all, and frees us
from the accursed load;
I bring my guilt to Jesus,
to wash my crimson stains
white in His blood most precious,
till not a spot remains.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I lay my wants on Jesus;
all fullness dwells in Him;
He heals all my diseases,
He doth my soul redeem;
I lay my griefs on Jesus,
my burdens and my cares;
He from them all releases,
He all my sorrows shares.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I rest my soul on Jesus,
this weary soul of mine;
His right hand me embraces,
I on his breast recline.
I love the Name of Jesus,
Immanuel, Christ, the Lord;
like fragrance on the breezes
His Name abroad is poured.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I long to be like Jesus,
meek, loving, lowly, mild;
I long to be like Jesus,
the Father's holy Child;
I long to be with Jesus,
amid the heav'nly throng,
to sing with saints His praises,
to learn the angels' song.</lines>
		</verse>
