		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sov'reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
for such a worm as I?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown,
and love beyond degree!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Thus might the sun in darkness hide
and shut his glories in,
when Christ, the mighty Maker died
for man the creature's sin.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Thus might I hide my blushing face
while His dear cross appears,
dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
and melt mine eyes to tears.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>But drops of tears can ne'er repay
the debt of love I owe;
here, Lord, I give myself away;
'tis all that I can do.</lines>
		</verse>
