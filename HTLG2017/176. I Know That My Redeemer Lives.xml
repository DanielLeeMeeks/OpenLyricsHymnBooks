		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I know that my Redeemer lives;
what comfort this sweet sentence gives!
He lives, He lives, who once was dead;
He lives, my everliving Head.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He lives triumphant from the grave,
He lives eternally to save,
He lives all-glorious in the sky,
He lives exalted there on high.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He lives to bless me with His love,
He lives to plead for me above,
He lives my hungry soul to feed,
He lives to help in time of need.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>He lives to grant me rich supply,
He lives to guide me with His eye,
He lives to comfort me when faint,
He live to hear my soul's complaint.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>He lives to silence all my fears,
He lives to wipe away my tears,
He lives to calm my troubled heart,
He lives all blessings to impart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>He lives, my kind, wise, heav'nly friend,
He lives and loves me to the end;
He lives, and while He lives, I'll sing;
He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>He lives and grants me daily breath;
He lives and I shall conquer death;
He lives my mansion to prepare;
He lives to bring me safely there.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v8">
			<lines>He lives, all glory to His name!
He lives, my Jesus, still the same.
Oh, the sweet joy this sentence gives,
"I know that my Redeemer lives!"</lines>
		</verse>
