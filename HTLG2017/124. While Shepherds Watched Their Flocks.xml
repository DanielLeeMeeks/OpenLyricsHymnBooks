		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
all seated on the ground,
an angel of the Lord came down,
and glory shone around.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>"Fear not," said he, for mighty dread
had seized their troubled mind;
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
to you and all mankind.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"To you, in David's town, this day,
is born of David's line
a Savior, who is Christ the Lord;
and this shall be the sign:</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>"The heav'nly Babe you there shall find
to human view displayed,
all meanly wrapped in swaddling clothes
and in a manger laid."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Thus spoke the seraph, and forthwith
appeared a shining throng
of angels, praising God, and thus
addressed their joyful song:</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>"All glory be to God on high,
and to the earth be peace;
goodwill henceforth from heav'n to men
begin and never cease."</lines>
		</verse>
