		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Stricken, smitten, and afflicted,
See Him dying on the tree!
'Tis the Christ by man rejected;
yes, my soul, 'tis He, 'tis He!
'Tis the long-expected Prophet,
David's Son, yet David's Lord;
by His Son God now has spoken:
'tis the true and faithful Word.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Tell me, ye who hear Him groaning,
was there ever grief like His?
Friends thro' fear His cause disowning,
foes insulting is distress;
many hands were raised to wound Him,
none would intervene to save;
but the deepest stroke that pierced Him
was the stroke that Justice gave.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Ye who think of sin but lightly
nor suppose the evil great
here may view its nature rightly,
here its guilt may estimate.
Mark the sacrifice appointed,
see who bears the awful load;
'tis the Word, the Lord's Anointed,
Son of Man and Son of God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Here we have a firm foundation;
here the refuge of the lost;
Christ, the Rock of our salvation,
His the Name of which we boast.
Lamb of God, for sinners wounded,
sacrifice to cancel guilt!
None shall ever be confounded
who on him their hope have built.</lines>
		</verse>
