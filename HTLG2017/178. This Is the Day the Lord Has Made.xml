		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>This is the day the Lord has made;
He calls the hours His own;
let heav'n rejoice, let earth be glad,
and praise surround the throne.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Today he rose and left the dead,
and Satan's empire fell;
today the saints His triumphs spread,
and all His wonders tell.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Hosanna to th'anointed King,
to David's holy Son.
help us, O LORD, descend and bring
salvation from Your throne.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Blest be the Lord, who comes to us
with messages of grace;
who comes, in God His Father's name,
to save our sinful race.</lines>
		</verse>
