		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Crown Him with many crowns,
the Lamb upon His throne;
hark, how the heav'nly anthem drowns
all music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
of Him who died for thee,
and hail Him as thy matchless King
through all eternity.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Crown Him the Lord of love;
behold His hands and side,
rich wounds, yet visible above,
in beauty glorified:
no angel in the sky
can fully bear that sight,
but downward bends his burning eye
at mysteries so bright.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Crown Him the Lord of life,
who triumphed o'er the grave,
and rose victorious in the strife
for those He came to save.
His glories now we sing,
who died and rose on high,
who died eternal life to bring,
and lives that death may die.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Crown Him the Lord of heav'n!
One with the Father known,
one with the Spirit through Him giv'n
from yonder glorious throne;
to Thee be endless praise,
for Thou for us hast died;
be Thou, O Lord, through endless days
adored and magnified.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Crown Him the Son of God,
before the worlds began,
and ye who tread where He hath trod,
crown Him the Son of Man.
All hail, Redeemer, hail;
for Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
throughout eternity!</lines>
		</verse>
