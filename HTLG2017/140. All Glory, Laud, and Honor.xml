		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>All glory, laud, and honor
to Thee, Redeemer, King,
to whom the lips of children
made sweet hosannas ring:
Thou art the King of Israel
Thou David’s royal Son,
who in the Lord’s name comest,
the King and blessed One.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The people of the Hebrews
with palms before Thee went;
our praise and prayer and anthems
before Thee we present.
To Thee, before Thy passion,
they sang their hymns of praise;
to Thee, now high exalted,
our melody we raise.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Thou didst accept their praises;
accept the pray'rs we bring,
who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King!
The company of angels
are praising Thee on high,
and we with all creation
in chorus make reply.</lines>
		</verse>
