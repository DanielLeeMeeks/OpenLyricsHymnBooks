		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven;
to His feet thy tribute bring.
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
evermore His praises sing:
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Praise Him for His grace and favor
to our fathers in distress.
Praise Him still the same as ever,
slow to chide, and swift to bless.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Fatherlike He tends and spares us;
well our feeble frame He knows.
In His hands He gently bears us,
rescues us from all our foes.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Frail as summer's flow'r we flourish,
blows the wind and it is gone;
but while mortals rise and perish,
God endures unchanging on.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Angels, help us to adore Him;
ye behold Him face to face;
saints triumphant, bow down before Him,
gathered in from ev'ry race.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise the everlasting King.</lines>
		</verse>
