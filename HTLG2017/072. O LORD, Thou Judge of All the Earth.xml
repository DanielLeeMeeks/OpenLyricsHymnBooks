		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O LORD, Thou Judge of all the earth,
to whom all vengeance doth belong,
arise and show Thy glory forth,
requite the proud, condemn the wrong.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>How long, O LORD, in boastful pride
shall wicked men triumphant stand?
How long shall they afflict Thy saints
and scorn Thy wrath, Thy dreadful hand?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Be wise, ye fools and brutish men;
shall not He see who formed the eye?
Shall not He hear who formed the ear,
and judge, who reigneth God most high?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The LORD will judge in righteousness,
from Him all truth and knowledge flow;
the foolish thoughts of wicked men,
how vain they are the LORD doth know.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>That man is blest whom Thou, O LORD,
with chastening hand dost teach Thy will,
for in the day when sinners fall
that man in peace abideth still.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Unless the Lord had been my Help,
my life had quickly passed away;
but when my foot had almost slipped,
O LORD, Thy mercy was my stay.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>Amid the doubts that fill my mind
Thy comforts, LORD, bring joy to me;
can wickedness, though throned in might,
have fellowship, O LORD, with Thee?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v8">
			<lines>The wicked, in their might arrayed,
against the righteous join their pow'r,
but to the LORD I flee for help;
He is my Refuge and my Tow'r.</lines>
		</verse>
