		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>This is my Father’s world,
and to my list'ning ears
all nature sings, and 'round me rings
the music of the spheres.
This is my Father’s world;
I rest me in the thought
of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;
His hand the wonders wrought.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>This is my Father’s world;
the birds their carols raise;
the morning light, the lily white
declare their Maker’s praise.
This is my Father’s world,
He shines in all that’s fair;
in the rustling grass I hear Him pass;
He speaks to me ev'rywhere.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>This is my Father’s world;
O, let me not forget
that though the wrong seems oft so strong,
God is the Ruler yet.
This is my Father’s world;
why should my heart be sad?
The Lord is King, let heavens ring!
God reigns; Let earth be glad!</lines>
		</verse>
