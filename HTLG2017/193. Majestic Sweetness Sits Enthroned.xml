		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
upon the Savior's brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o'erflow,
His lips with grace o'erflow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>No mortal can with Him compare,
among the sons of men;
fairer is He than all the fair
who fill the heav'nly train,
who fill the heav'nly train.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He saw me plunged in deep distress,
and flew to my relief;
for me He bore the shameful cross,
and carried all my grief,
and carried all my grief.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>To Him I owe my life and breath,
and all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
and saves me from the grave,
and saves me from the grave.</lines>
		</verse>
