		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>On Christ salvation rests secure;
the Rock of Ages must endure;
nor can that faith be overthrown
which rests upon the "Living Stone."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>No other hope shall intervene;
to Him we look, on Him we lean;
other foundations we disown
and build on Christ the "Living Stone."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>In Him, it is ordained to raise
a temple to Jehovah's praise
composed of all the saints, who own
no Savior but the "Living Stone."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>View the vast building, see it rise;
the work how great! the plan how wise!
O wondrous fabric, pow'r unknown
that rests it on the "Living Stone."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>But most adore His precious name;
His glory and His grace proclaim;
for us, condemned, despised, undone,
He gave Himself, the "Living Stone."</lines>
		</verse>
