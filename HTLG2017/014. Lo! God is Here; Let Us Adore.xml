		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Lo, God is here! let us adore,
and own how dreadful is this place;
let all within us feel His pow'r,
and humbly bow before His face.
Who knows His pow'r, His grace who proves,
serve Him with awe, with rev'rence love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Lo, God is here, whom day and night
united choirs of angels praise;
to Him, enthroned above all height,
the host of heav'n their anthems raise.
Disdain not, Lord, our meaner song,
who praise Thee with a stamm'ring tongue.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Almighty Father, may our praise
Thy courts with grateful fragrance fill;
still may we stand before Thy face,
still hear and do Thy sov'reign will.
To God whom earth and heav'n adore,
be praise and glory evermore.</lines>
		</verse>
