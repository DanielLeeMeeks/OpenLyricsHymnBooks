		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>What God ordains is always good:
His will is just and holy.
As He directs my life for me,
I follow meek and lowly.
My God indeed in ev'ry need
knows well how He will shield me;
to Him, then, I will yield me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>What God ordains is always good:
He never will deceive me;
He leads me in His righteous way,
and never will He leave me.
I take content what He has sent;
His hand that sends me sadness
will turn my tears to gladness.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>What God ordains is always good:
His loving thought attends me;
no poison can be in the cup
that my Physician sends me.
My God is true; each morning new
I trust His grace unending,
My life to Him commending.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>What God ordains is always good:
He is my Friend and Father;
He suffers naught to do me harm
though many storms may gather.
Now I may know both joy and woe;
some day I shall see clearly
that He has loved me dearly.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>What God ordains is always good:
though I the cup am drinking
which savors now of bitterness,
I take it without shrinking.
For after grief God gives relief,
my heart with comfort filling
and all my sorrow stilling.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>What God ordains is always good:
this truth remains unshaken.
Though sorrow, need, or death be mine,
I shall not be forsaken.
I fear no harm, for with His arm
He shall embrace and shield me;
so to my God I yield me.</lines>
		</verse>
