		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come, Thou long-expected Jesus,
born to set Thy people free;
from our fears and sins release us,
let us find our rest in Thee.
Israel's strength and consolation,
hope of all the earth Thou art;
dear Desire of ev'ry nation,
joy of ev'ry longing heart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Born Thy people to deliver,
born a child and yet a King;
born to reign in us forever,
now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
By thine own eternal Spirit
rule in all our hearts alone;
by Thine all-sufficient merit,
raise us to Thy glorious throne.</lines>
		</verse>
