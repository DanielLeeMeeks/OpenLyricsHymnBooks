		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>His be the Victor’s name,
who fought the fight alone;
triumphant saints no honor claim;
His conquest was their own.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>By weakness and defeat
He won a glorious crown,
trod all our foes beneath His feet
by being trodden down.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He Satan’s pow'r laid low;
made sin, He sin o’erthrew;
bowed to the grave, destroyed it so,
and death, by dying, slew.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Bless, bless the Conqu'ror slain,
slain in His victory;
who lived, who died, who lives again —
For thee, His church, for thee!</lines>
		</verse>
