		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Amidst us our Beloved stands,
and bids us view His pierced hands;
points to the wounded feet and side,
blest emblems of the Crucified.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>What food luxurious loads the board,
when, at His table, sits the Lord!
The cup how rich, the bread how sweet,
when Jesus deigns the guests to meet!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>If now, with eyes defiled and dim,
we see the signs, but see not Him;
O may His love the scales displace,
and bid us see Him face to face!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Our former transports we recount,
when with Him in the holy mount:
these cause our souls to thirst anew
His marred but lovely face to view.</lines>
		</verse>
