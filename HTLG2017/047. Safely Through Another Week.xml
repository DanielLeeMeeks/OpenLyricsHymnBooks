		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Safely through another week
God has brought us on our way;
let us now a blessing seek,
waiting in His courts today;
day of all the week the best,
emblem of eternal rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>While we pray for pard'ning grace,
through the dear Redeemer's name,
show Thy reconciling face;
take away our sin and shame;
from our worldly cares set free,
may we rest this day in Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Here we come Thy name to praise,
let us feel Thy presence near;
may Thy glory meet our eyes,
while we in Thy house appear:
here afford us, Lord, a taste
of our everlasting feast.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>May Thy gospel's joyful sound
conquer sinners, comfort saints;
may the fruits of grace abound,
bring relief for all complaints:
thus may all our Sabbaths prove,
till we join the church above.</lines>
		</verse>
