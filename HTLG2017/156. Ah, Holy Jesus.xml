		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Ah, holy Jesus, how have You offended,
that that mortal judgment has on You descended?
By foes derided, by Your own rejected,
O most afflicted!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Who was the guilty? Who brought this upon You?
Alas, my treason, Jesus, has undone You!
'Twas I, Lord Jesus, I it was denied You,
I crucified You.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Lo, the Good Shepherd for the sheep is offered;
the slave has sinn√®d, and the Son has suffered.
For our atonement, while we nothing heeded,
God interceded.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>For me, kind Jesus, was Your incarnation,
Your mortal sorrow, and Your life's oblation;
Your death of anguish and Your bitter passion,
for my salvation.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Therefore, kind Jesus, since I cannot pay You,
I do adore You, and will ever pray You,
think on Your pity and Your love unswerving,
not my deserving.</lines>
		</verse>
