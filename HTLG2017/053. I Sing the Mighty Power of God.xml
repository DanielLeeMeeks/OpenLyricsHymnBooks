		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I sing the mighty pow'r of God
that made the mountains rise,
that spread the flowing seas abroad
and built the lofty skies.
I sing the wisdom that ordained
the sun to rule the day;
the moon shines full at His command,
and all the stars obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I sing the goodness of the Lord
that filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures with His Word
and then pronounced them good.
Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed,
where'er I turn my eye
if I survey the ground I tread,
or gaze upon the sky.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>There's not a plant or flow'r below
but makes Thy glories known;
and clouds arise and tempests blow
by order from Thy throne;
while all that borrows life from Thee
is ever in Thy care,
and ev'rywhere that man can be,
Thou, God, art present there.</lines>
		</verse>
