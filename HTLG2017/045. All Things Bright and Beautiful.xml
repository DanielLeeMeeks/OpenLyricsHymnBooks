		<verse name="c">
		<lines>All things bright and beautiful,
all creatures great and small,
all things wise and wonderful,
the Lord God made them all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Each little flow'r that opens,
each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colors,
He made their tiny wings. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The purple-headed mountain,
the river running by,
the sunset and the morning
that brightens up the sky. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The cold wind in the winter,
the pleasant summer sun,
the ripe fruits in the garden:
He made them ev'ry one. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>He gave us eyes to see them,
and lips that we might tell
how great is God Almighty,
who has made all things well. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
