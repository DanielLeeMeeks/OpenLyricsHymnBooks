		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus in His heav'nly glory,
sits with God upon the throne;
noun more to be forsaken,
His humiliation gone.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Never more shall God, Jehovah,
smite the Shepherd with the sword;
ne'er again shall cruel sinners
set at nought our glorious Lord.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Dwelling in eternal sunshine
of the countenance of God,
Jesus fills all heaven with incense
of HIs reconciling blood.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>On His heart our names are graven,
on His shoulders we are borne;
of our God beloved in Jesus,
we can love Him in return.</lines>
		</verse>
