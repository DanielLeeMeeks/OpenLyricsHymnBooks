		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>My song is love unknown,
my Savior’s love to me;
love to the loveless shown,
that they might lovely be.
O who am I, that for my sake,
my Lord should take frail flesh and die?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He came from His blest throne
salvation to bestow;
but man made strange, and none
the longed-for Christ would know.
But oh, my Friend, my Friend indeed,
who at my need His life did spend!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Sometimes they strew His way
and His sweet praises sing;
resounding all the way
hosannas to their King.
Then “Crucify!” is all their breath,
and for His death they thirst and cry.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Why, what hath my Lord done?
What makes this rage and spite?
He made the lame to run,
He gave the blind their sight.
Sweet injuries! Yet they at these
themselves displease,
and 'gainst Him rise.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>They rise, and needs will have
my dear Lord made away;
a murderer they save,
the Prince of Life they slay.
Yet cheerful He to suffering goes,
that He His foes from thence might free.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>In life, no house, no home
my Lord on earth might have;
in death, no friendly tomb
but what a stranger gave.
What may I say? Heav'n was His home,
but mine the tomb wherein He lay.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>Here might I stay and sing,
no story so divine;
never was love, dear King,
never was grief like Thine.
This is my Friend, in whose sweet praise
I all my days could gladly spend.</lines>
		</verse>
