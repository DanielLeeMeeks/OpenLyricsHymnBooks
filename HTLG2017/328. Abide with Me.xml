		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
the darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
earth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away.
Change and decay in all around I see.
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour;
what but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who like Thyself my Guide and Stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;
ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;
shine through the gloom and point me to the skies.
Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee.
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.</lines>
		</verse>
