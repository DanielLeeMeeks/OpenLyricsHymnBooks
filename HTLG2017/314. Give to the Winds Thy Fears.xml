		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Give to the winds thy fears,
hope and be undismayed;
God hears thy sighs and counts thy tears;
God shall lift up thy head.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Through waves and clouds and storms,
He gently clears the way;
wait thou His time, so shall this night
soon end in joyous day.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Still heavy is thy heart,
still sink thy spirits down?
Cast off the weight, let fear depart,
and ev'ry care be gone.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>What though thou rules not,
yet heav'n, and earth, and hell
proclaim, God sitteth on the throne,
and ruleth all things well.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Leave to His sov'reign sway
to choose and to command.
so shalt thou wond'ring own His way,
how wise, how strong His hand!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Far, far above thy thought
His counsel shall appear,
when fully He the work hath wrought,
that caused thy needless fear.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>Thou seest our weakness, Lord,
our hearts are known to Thee;
O lift Thou up the sinking heart,
confirm the feeble knee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v8">
			<lines>Let us in life, in death,
Thy steadfast truth declare,
and publish with our latest breath
Thy love and guardian care.</lines>
		</verse>
