		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O Jesus, I have promised
to serve Thee to the end;
be Thou forever near me,
my Master and my Friend;
I shall not fear the battle
if Thou art by my side,
nor wander from the pathway
if Thou wilt be my guide.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O let me feel Thee near me,
the world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
the tempting sounds I hear;
my foes are ever near me,
around me and within;
but, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
and shield my soul from sin.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O let me hear Thee speaking
in accents clear and still,
above the storms of passion,
the murmurs of self-will;
O speak to reassure me,
to hasten or control;
O speak, and make me listen,
Thou Guardian of my soul.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O Jesus, Thou hast promised
to all who follow Thee,
that where Thou art in glory,
there shall Thy servant be;
and, Jesus, I have promised
to serve Thee to the end;
O give me grace to follow,
my Master and my Friend.</lines>
		</verse>
