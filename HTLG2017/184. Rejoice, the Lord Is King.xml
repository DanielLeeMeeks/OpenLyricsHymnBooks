		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Rejoice! the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore.
Rejoice, give thanks and sing
and triumph evermore:
lift up your heart! Lift up your voice;
rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus, the Savior reigns,
the God of truth and love;
when He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above:
lift up your heart! Lift up your voice;
rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>His Kingdom cannot fail,
He rules o'er earth and heav'n;
the keys of death and hell
are to our Jesus giv'n:
lift up your heart! Lift up your voice;
rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Rejoice in glorious hope,
for Christ the Judge shall come
to gather all His saints
to their eternal home:
lift up your heart! Lift up your voice;
rejoice, again I say, rejoice!</lines>
