		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Oh, what their joy and their glory must be,
those endless Sabbaths the blessed ones see!
Crowns for the valiant, to weary ones rest;
God shall be all, and in all, ever blest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>In new Jerusalem joy shall be found,
blessings of peace shall forever abound;
wish and fulfillment are not severed there,
nor the things prayed for come short of the pray'r.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>We, where no troubles distraction can bring,
safely the anthems of Zion shall sing;
while for Your grace, Lord, their voices of praise
Your blessed people shall evermore raise.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Now let us worship our Lord and our King,
joyfully raising our voices to sing:
Praise to the Father, and praise to the Son,
praise to the Spirit, to God, Three in One.</lines>
		</verse>
