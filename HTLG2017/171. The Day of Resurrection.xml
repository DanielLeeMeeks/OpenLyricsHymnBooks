		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The day of resurrection!
Earth, tell it out abroad;
the Passover of gladness,
the Passover of God.
From death to life eternal,
from this world to the sky,
our Christ hath brought us over,
with hymns of victory.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Our hearts be pure from evil,
that we may see aright
the Lord in rays eternal
of resurrection light;
and, list'ning to His accents,
may hear, so calm and plain,
His own "All hail!" and, hearing,
may raise the victor strain.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Now let the heav'ens be joyful!
Let earth the song begin!
Let world resound in triumph,
and all that is therein;
let all things seen and unseen
their notes in gladness blend;
for Christ the Lord hath risen,
our Jjoy that hath no end.</lines>
		</verse>
