		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Praise to the LORD, the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation.
All ye who hear,
now to His temple draw near:
join me in glad adoration!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Praise to the LORD, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
shelters thee under His wings, yea, so gently sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen
how thy desires e'er have been
granted in what He ordaineth?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Praise to the LORD, who with marvelous wisdom hath made thee,
decked thee with health, and with loving han guided and stayed thee.
How oft in grief
hath not He brought thee relief,
spreading His wings for to shade thee!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Praise to the LORD, who doth prosper thy works and defend thee;
surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee.
Ponder anew
what the Almighty can do,
if with His love He befriend thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Praise to the LORD, O let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!
Let the amen
sound from His people again:
gladly forever adore Him!</lines>
