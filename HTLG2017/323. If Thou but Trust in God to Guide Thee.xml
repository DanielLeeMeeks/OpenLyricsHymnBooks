		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>If thou but trust in God to guide thee
and hope in Him through all thy ways,
He'll give thee strength, whate'er betide thee,
and bear thee through the evil days;
who trusts in God's unchanging love
builds on the Rock that naught can move.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>What can these anxious cares avail thee,
these never-ceasing moans and sighs?
What can it help if thou bewail thee
o'er each dark moment as it flies?
Our cross and trials do but press
the heavier for our bitterness.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Only be still, and wait His leisure
in cheerful hope, with heart content
to take whate'er thy Father's pleasure
and all-discerning love have sent;
nor doubt our inmost wants are known
to Him who chose us for His own.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>All are alike before the Highest;
'tis easy to our God, we know,
to raise thee up though low thou livest,
to make the rich man poor and low;
true wonders still be Him are wrought
who setteth up and bright to naught.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving;
in all thy labor faithful be,
and trust His Word; though undeserving,
thou yet shalt find it true for thee.
God never will forsook in need
the soul that trusts in Him indeed.</lines>
		</verse>
