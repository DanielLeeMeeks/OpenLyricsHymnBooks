	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The spacious heav'ns declare
the glory of our God,
the firmament displays
His handiwork abroad;
day unto day proclaims His might,
and night His wisdom tells to night.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Aloud they do not speak,
they utter forth no word,
nor into language break -
their voice is never heard;
yet through the world the truth they bear
and their Creator's pow'r declare.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The clouds of heav'n are spread,
a tent to hold the sun,
and like a bridegroom fair
comes forth the mighty one,
rejoicing in his strength and grace
to run his wondrous daily race.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>His daily going forth
is from the end of heav'n;
the firmament to him
is for his circuit giv'n;
his journey reaches to its ends,
and ev'rywhere his heat extends.</lines>
		</verse>
