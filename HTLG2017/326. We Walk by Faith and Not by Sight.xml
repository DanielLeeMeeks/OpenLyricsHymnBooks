		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>We walk by faith, and not by sight;
no gracious words we hear
from Him who spoke as none e'er spoke,
but we believe Him near.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>We may not touch His hands and side,
nor follow where He trod;
but in His promise we rejoice
and cry, "My Lord and God!"</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Help then, O Lord, our unbelief;
and may our faith abound
to call on You when You are near
and seek where You are found.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>That, when our life of faith is done,
in realms of clearer light,
may we behold You as You are,
with full and endless sight.</lines>
		</verse>
