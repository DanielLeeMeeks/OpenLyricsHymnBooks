		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Sing praise to God who reigns above,
the God of all creation;
the God of pow'r, the God of love,
the God of our salvation;
with healing balm my soul He fills,
and ev'ry faithless murmur stills -
to God all praise and glory!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>What God's almighty pow'r has made
in mercy He is keeping,
by morning glow or evening shade
His eye is never sleeping;
within the kingdom of His might,
lo! all is just and all is right -
to God all praise and glory!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The Lord is never far away,
but through all grief distressing,
an ever-present help and stay,
our peace and joy and blessing;
as with a mother's tender hand
He leads His own, His chosen band -
to God all praise and glory!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Thus all my toilsome way along,
I sing aloud His praises,
that all may hear the grateful song
my voice unwearied raises:
"Be joyful in the Lord, my heart!
Both soul and body bear your part -
to God all praise and glory!</lines>
		</verse>
