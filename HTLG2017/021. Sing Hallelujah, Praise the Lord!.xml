		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Sing hallelujah, praise the Lord!
Sing with a cheerful voice;
exalt our God with one accord,
and in His Name rejoice.
Ne’er cease to sing, O ransomed host,
praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
until in realms of endless light
your praises shall unite.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>There we to all eternity
shall join th'angelic lays
and sing in perfect harmony
to God our Savior’s praise;
He has redeemed us by His blood,
and made us kings and priests to God;
for us, for us, the Lamb was slain!
Praise ye the Lord! Amen.</lines>
