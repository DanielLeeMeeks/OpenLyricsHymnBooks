		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I will sing of my Redeemer
and His wondrous love to me;
on the cruel cross He suffered,
from the curse to set me free.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Sing, O sing of my Redeemer!
with His blood He purchased me;
on the cross He sealed my pardon,
paid the debt, and made me free.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I will tell the wondrous story,
how my lost estate to save,
in His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave. [Refrain]
I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant pow'r I'll tell,
how the victory He giveth
over sin, and death, and hell. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I will sing of my Redeemer
and His heav'nly love for me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God, with him to be. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
