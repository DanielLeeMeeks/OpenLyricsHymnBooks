		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>That man is blest who, fearing God,
from sin restrains his feet,
who will not stand with wicked men,
who shuns the scorners' seat.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Yea, blest is he who makes God's law
his portion and delight,
and meditates upon that law
with gladness day and night.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>That man is nourished like a tree
set by the rivers' side;
its leaf is green, its fruit is sure,
and thus his works abide.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The wicked like the driven chaff
are swept from off the land;
they shall not gather with the just,
nor in the judgment stand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>The LORD will guard the righteous well,
their way to Him is known;
the way of sinners, far from God,
shall surely be o'erthrown.</lines>
		</verse>
