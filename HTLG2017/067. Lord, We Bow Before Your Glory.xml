		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Lord, we bow before Your glory
manifested in Your Son.
Radiant with Your perfect beauty,
He is heav'n's Beloved One.
Saving grace has given us vision,
opened eyes that one were blind.
He on whom brought derision
now delights our heart and mind.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Such a Savior, now exalted,
well deserves our heartfelt praise.
Dying He has death defeated;
ris'n He reigns for endless days.
Now in heaven interceding,
Jesus, Friend of sinners, prays
for the weakest, daily pleading;
all sufficient is His grace.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O that we might know You better,
Jesus Christ, our living Lord.
Let our love grow daily greater
as we hear Your Holy Word.
There You have revealed Your glory,
there we marvel at Your grace.
Feed our souls and make us like You
till we see You face to face.</lines>
		</verse>
