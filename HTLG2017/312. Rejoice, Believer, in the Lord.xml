		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Rejoice, believer, in the Lord,
who makes your cause His own;
the hope that's built upon His Word
can ne'er be overthrown.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Though many foes beset your road,
and feeble is your arm,
your life is hid with Christ in God
beyond the reach of harm.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Weak as you are, you shall not faint
or fainting, shall not die!
Jesus, the strength of ev'ry saint,
will aid you from on high.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Thou sometimes unperceived by sense,
faith sees Him always near!
a Guide, a Glory, a Defense;
then what have you to fear?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>As surely as He overcame
and triumphed once for you,
so surely you that love His name
shall in Him triumph too.</lines>
		</verse>
