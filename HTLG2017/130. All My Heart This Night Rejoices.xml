		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>All my heart this night rejoices
as I hear
far and near
sweetest angel voices.
"Christ is born," their choirs are singing
till the air
ev'rywhere
now with joy is ringing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Forth today the Conqu'ror goeth,
who the foe,
sin and woe,
death and hell, o'erthroweth.
God is man, man to deliver;
His dear Son
now is one
with our blood forever.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Shall we still dread God's displeasure,
who, to save,
freely gave
His most cherished Treasure?
To redeem us, He hath given
His own Son
from the throne
of His might in heaven.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>He becomes the Lamb that taketh
sin away
and for aye
full atonement maketh.
For our life His own He tenders;
and our race,
by His grace,
fit for glory renders.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Hark! a voice from yonder manger,
soft and sweet,
doth entreat,
"Flee from woe and danger;
brethren, from all ills that grieve you
you are freed;
all you need
I will surely give you."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Come, then, banish all your sadness,
one and all,
great and small;
come with songs of gladness.
Love Him who with love is glowing;
hail the star,
near and far
light and joy bestowing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>Dearest Lord, Thee will I cherish.
Though my breath
fail in death,
yet I shall not perish,
but with Thee abide forever
there on high,
in that joy
which can vanish never.</lines>
		</verse>
