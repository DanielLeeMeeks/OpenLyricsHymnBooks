		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Good Christian men, rejoice
with heart and soul and voice!
Give ye heed to what we say:
News! News!
Jesus Christ is born today!
Ox and ass before Him bow,
and He is in the manger now.
Christ is born today!
Christ is born today!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Good Christian men, rejoice
with heart and soul and voice!
Now ye hear of endless bliss:
Joy! Joy!
Jesus Christ was born for this!
He has opened heaven's door,
and man is blest forevermore.
Christ was born for this!
Christ was born for this!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Good Christian men, rejoice
with heart and soul and voice!
Now ye need not fear the grave:
Peace! Peace!
Jesus Christ was born to save!
Calls you one and calls you all
to gain his everlasting hall.
Christ was born to save!
Christ was born to save!</lines>
		</verse>
