		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Go to dark Gethsemane,
all who feel the tempter's pow'r;
your Redeemer's conflict see;
watch with Him one bitter hour;
turn not from His griefs away;
learn of Jesus Christ to pray.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Follow to the judgment hall,
view the Lord of life arraigned;
Oh, the wormwood and the gall!
Oh, the pangs His soul sustained!
Shun not suff'ring, shame, or loss;
learn from Him to bear the cross.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Calv'ry's mournful mountain climb;
there, adoring at His feet,
mark the miracle of time,
God's own sacrifice complete.
"It is finished!" hear Him cry;
learn from Jesus Christ to die.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Early hasten to the tomb
where they laid His breathless clay,
all is solitude and gloom,
who has taken Him away?
Christ is ris'n! He meets our eyes.
Savior, teach us so to rise.</lines>
		</verse>
