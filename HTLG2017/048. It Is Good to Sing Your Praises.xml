		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>It is good to sing Your praises
and to thank You, O Most High,
showing forth Your loving-kindness
when the morning lights the sky.
It is good when night is falling
of Your faithfulness to tell,
while with sweet, melodious praises
songs of adoration swell.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>You have filled my heart with gladness
through the works Your hands have wrought;
You have made my life victorious;
great Your works and deep Your thought.
You, O Lord, on high exalted,
reign forevermore in might;
all Your enemies shall perish,
sin be banished from Your sight.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>But the good shall live before You,
planted in Your dwelling place,
fruitful trees and ever verdant,
nourished by Your boundless grace.
In His goodness to the righteous
God His righteousness displays;
God, my Rock, my Strength and Refuge,
just and true are all Your ways.</lines>
		</verse>
