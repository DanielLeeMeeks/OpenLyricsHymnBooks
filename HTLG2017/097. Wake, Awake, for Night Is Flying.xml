		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Wake, awake, for night is flying,
the watchmen on the heights are crying;
awake, Jerusalem, at last.
Midnight hears the welcome voices,
and at the thrilling cry rejoices:
"Come forth, you maidens! Night is past.
The Bridegroom comes! Awake;
your lamps with gladness take!"
Alleluia!
Prepare yourselves to meet the Lord,
whose light has stirred the waiting guard.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Zion hears the watchmen singing,
and in her heart new joy is springing.
She wakes, she rises from her gloom,
for her Lord comes down all-glorious,
and strong in grace, in truth victorious.
Her star is ris'n; her light is come.
O, come, you Blessed One,
Lord Jesus, God's own Son.
Sing hosanna!
We go until the halls we view
where You have bid us dine with You.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Now let all the heav'ns adore You,
and saints and angels sing before You.
The harps and cymbals all unite.
Of one pearl each shining portal,
where, dwelling with the choir immortal,
we gather round your dazzling light.
No eye has seen, no ear
has yet been trained to hear
what joy is ours!
Crescendos rise; Your halls resound;
hosannas blend in cosmic sound.</lines>
		</verse>
