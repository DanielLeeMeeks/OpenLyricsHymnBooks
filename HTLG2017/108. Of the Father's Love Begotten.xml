		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Of the Father’s love begotten
ere the worlds began to be,
He is Alpha and Omega;
He the source, the ending He,
of the things that are, that have been,
and that future years shall see
evermore and evermore!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O that birth forever blessed,
when a virgin, full of grace,
by the Holy Ghost conceiving,
bore the Savior of our race;
and the Babe, the world’s Redeemer,
first revealed his sacred face,
evermore and evermore!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O ye heights of heaven adore Him,
angel hosts, His praises sing,
pow'ers, dominions, bow before Him,
and extol our God and King;
let no tongue on earth be silent,
ev'ery voice in concert ring
evermore and evermore!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Christ, to Thee with God the Father
and, O Holy Ghost, to Thee,
hymn and chant and high thanksgiving
and unwearied praises be:
honor, glory, and dominion,
and eternal victory
evermore and evermore!</lines>
		</verse>
