		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O my soul, bless your Redeemer;
all within me bless God's Name;
bless the Savior, and forget not
all God's mercies to proclaim.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>God forgives all your transgressions,
all diseases gently heals;
God redeems you from destruction,
and with you so kindly deals.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Far as east from west is distant,
God has put away our sin;
like the pity of a father
has the Lord's compassion been.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>As it was without beginning,
so it lasts without an end;
to their children's children ever
shall God's righteousness extend.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Unto such as keep God's covâ€™nant
and are steadfast in God's way;
unto those who still remember
the commandments and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Bless your Maker, all you creatures,
ever under God's control,
all throughout God's vast dominion;
bless the Lord of all, my soul!</lines>
		</verse>
