		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Give to our God immortal praise;
mercy and truth are all His ways;
wonders of grace to God belong,
repeat His mercies in your song.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Give to the Lord of lords renown,
the King of kings with glory crown;
His mercies ever shall endure,
when lords and kings are known no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He built the earth, He spread the sky,
and fixed the starry lights on high;
wonders of grace to God belong;
repeat His mercies in your song.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>He fills the sun with morning light,
He bids the moon direct the night;
His mercies ever shall endure,
when suns and moons shall shine no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>The Jews He freed from Pharaoh's hand
and brought them to the promised land;
wonders of grace to God belong,
repeat His mercies in your song.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>He saw the Gentiles dead in sin
and felt His pity move within;
His mercies ever shall endure,
when death and sin shall reign no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>He sent His Son with pow'r to save
from guilt, and darkness, and the grave;
wonders of grace to God belong,
repeat His mercies in your song.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v8">
			<lines>Through this vain world He guides our feet
and leads us to His heav'nly seat;
His mercies ever shall endure,
when this vain world shall be no more.</lines>
		</verse>
