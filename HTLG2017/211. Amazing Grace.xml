		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Amazing grace! how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
was blind, but now I see.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved;
how precious did that grace appear
the hour I first believed!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come;
'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
and grace will lead me home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be
as long as life endures.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>The earth shall soon dissolve like snow;
the sun forbear to shine;
but God, who called me here below,
will be forever mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>When we've been there ten thousand years,
bright shining as the sun,
we've no less days to sing God's praise
than when we'd first begun.</lines>
		</verse>
