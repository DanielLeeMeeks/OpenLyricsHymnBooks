		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>What various hindrances we meet
in coming to the mercy seat!
Yet who that knows the worth of pray'r
but wishes to be often there!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Pray'r makes the darkened clouds withdraw;
pray'r climbs the ladder Jacob saw;
gives exercise to faith and love;
brings ev'ry blessing from above.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Restraining pray'r, we cease to fight;
pray'r makes the Christian’s armor bright;
and Satan trembles when he sees
the weakest saint upon his knees.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Have you no words? Ah, think again:
words flow apace when you complain,
and fill a fellow-creature’s ear
with the sad tale of all your care.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Were half the breath thus vainly spent
to heav’n in supplication sent,
our cheerful song would oft’ner be,
"Hear what the Lord hath done for me!"</lines>
		</verse>
