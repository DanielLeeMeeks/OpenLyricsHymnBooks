		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Christ Jesus lay in death’s strong bands,
for our offenses given;
but now at God’s right hand He stands
and brings us light from heaven.
Therefore let us joyful be
and sing to God right thankfully
loud songs of hallelujah.
Hallelujah!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>It was a strange and dreadful strife
when life and death contended;
the victory remained with life,
the reign of death was ended.
Holy Scripture plainly saith
that death is swallowed up by death;
his sting is lost forever.
Hallelujah!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Here the true Paschal Lamb we see,
whom God so freely gave us;
He died on the accursed tree -
so strong His love to save us.
See, His blood doth mark our door;
faith points to it, death passes o'er,
and Satan cannot harm us.
Hallelujah!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>So let us keep the festival
whereto the Lord invites us;
Christ is Himself the Joy of all,
the Sun that warms and lights us.
By His grace He doth impart
eternal sunshine to the heart;
the night of sin is ended.
Hallelujah!</lines>
