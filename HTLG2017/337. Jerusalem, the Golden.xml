		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jerusalem the golden,
with milk and honey blest,
beneath your contemplation
sink heart and voice oppressed;
I know not, O I know not
what joys await us there,
what radiancy of glory,
what bliss beyond compare!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>They stand, those halls of Zion,
all jubilant with song,
and bright with many an angel,
and all the martyr throng;
the Prince is ever in them,
the daylight is serene;
the pastures of the blessed
are decked in glorious sheen.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>There is the throne of David;
and there, from care released,
the shout of them that triumph,
the song of them that feast;
and they, who with their Leader
have conquered in the fight,
forever and forever
are clad in robes of white.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O sweet and blessed country,
the home of God's elect!
O sweet and blessed country
that eager hearts expect!
In mercy, Jesus, bring us
to that dear land of rest,
who are, with God the Father
and Spirit, ever blest.</lines>
		</verse>
