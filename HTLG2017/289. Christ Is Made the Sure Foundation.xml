		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and cornerstone,
chosen of the Lord, and precious,
binding all the church in one,
Holy Zion's help for ever,
and her confidence alone.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>All that dedicated city,
dearly loved of God on high,
in exultant jubilation
pours perpetual melody;
God the One in Three adoring
in glad hymns eternally.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>To this temple, where we call You,
come, O Lord of Hosts, today:
with accustomed lovingkindness,
hear Your servants as they pray;
and Your fullest benediction
shed within its walls alway.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Lord, here grant to all Your servants
what they ask of You to gain,
what they gain from You, forever
with the blessed to retain,
and hereafter in Your glory
evermore with You to reign.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Praise and honor to the Father,
praise and honor to the Son,
praise and honor to the Spirit,
ever Three, and ever One,
one in might, and one in glory,
while unending ages run.</lines>
		</verse>
