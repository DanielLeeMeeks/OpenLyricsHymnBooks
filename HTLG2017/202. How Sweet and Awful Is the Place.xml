		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>How sweet and awful is the place
with Christ within the doors,
while everlasting love displays
the choicest of her stores.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>While all our hearts and all our songs
join to admire the feast,
each of us cries, with thankful tongue,
"Lord, why was I a guest?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"Why was I made to hear Thy voice,
and enter while there's room,
when thousands make a wretched choice,
and rather starve than come?"</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>'Twas the same love that spread the feast
that sweetly drew us in;
else we had still refused to taste,
and perished in our sin.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Pity the nations, O our God,
constrain the earth to come;
send Thy victorious Word abroad,
and bring the strangers home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>We long to see Thy churches full,
that all the chosen race
may, with one voice and heart and soul,
sing Thy redeeming grace.</lines>
		</verse>
