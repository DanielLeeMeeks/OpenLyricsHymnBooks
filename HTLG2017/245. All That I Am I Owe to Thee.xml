		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>All that I am I owe to Thee;
Thy wisdom, Lord, has fashioned me.
I give my Maker thankful praise,
whose wondrous works my soul amaze.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Ere into being I was brought,
Thine eye did see, and in Thy thought
my life in all its perfect plan
was ordered ere my days began.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Thy thoughts, O God, how manifold,
more precious unto me than gold!
I muse on their infinity,
awaking I am still with Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The wicked Thou wilt surely slay;
from me let sinners turn away.
They speak against the Name divine;
I count God's enemies as mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Search me, O God, my heart discern;
try me, my inmost thought to learn;
and lead me, if in sin I stray,
to choose the everlasting way.</lines>
		</verse>
