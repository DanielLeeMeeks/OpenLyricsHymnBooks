		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Ask ye what great thing I know
that delights and stirs me so?
What the high reward I win?
Whose the name I glory in?
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Who defeats my fiercest foes?
Who consoles my saddest woes?
Who revives my waiting heart,
healing all its hidden smart?
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Who is life in life to me?
Who the death of death will be?
Who will place me on His right
with the countless hosts of light?
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>This is that great thing I know;
this delights and stirs me so:
faith in Him who died to save,
Him who triumphed o'er the grave,
Jesus Christ, the Crucified.</lines>
		</verse>
