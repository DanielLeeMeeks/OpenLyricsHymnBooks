		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Ho! ye that thirst, approach the spring
where living waters flow:
free to that sacred fountain all
without a price may go.
How long to streams of false delight
will ye in crowds repair?
How long your strength and substance waste
on trifles light as air?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>My stores afford those rich supplies
that health and pleasure give;
incline your ear, and come to Me;
the soul that hears shall live.
With you a cov’nant I will make
that ever shall endure;
the hope which gladdened David’s heart
My mercy hath made sure.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Behold He comes! your Leader comes,
with might and honor crowned;
a Witness who shall spread My Name
to earth’s remotest bound.
See! nations hasten to His call
from ev’ry distant shore;
isles, yet unknown, shall bow to Him,
and Israel’s God adore.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Seek ye the LORD while yet His ear
is open to your call;
while offered mercy still is near,
before His footstool fall.
Let sinners quit their evil ways,
their evil thoughts forego,
and God, when they to Him return,
returning grace will show.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>With joy and peace shall then be led
the glad converted lands;
the lofty mountains then shall sing,
the forests clap their hands.
Where briers grew ‘midst barren wilds,
shall firs and myrtles spring;
And nature, through its utmost bounds,
eternal praises sing.</lines>
		</verse>
