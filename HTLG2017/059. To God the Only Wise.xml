			<lines>To God the only wise,
our Savior and our King,
let all the saints below the skies
their humble praises bring.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>â€™Tis His almighty love,
His counsel and His care,
preserves us safe from sin and death,
and ev'ry hurtful snare.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He will present our souls
unblemished and complete,
before the glory of His face,
with joys divinely great.</lines>

			<lines>Then all the chosen seed
shall meet around the throne,
shall bless the conduct of His grace,
And make His wonders known.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>To our Redeemer God
wisdom and pow'r belongs,
immortal crowns of majesty,
and everlasting songs.</lines>
