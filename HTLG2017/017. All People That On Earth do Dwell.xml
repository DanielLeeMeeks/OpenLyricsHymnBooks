	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>All people that on earth do dwell,
sing to the LORD with cheerful voice;
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell;
come ye before Him and rejoice.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Know that the LORD is God indeed;
without our aid He did us make;
we are His flock, He doth us feed,
and for His sheep He doth us take.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O enter then His gates with praise,
approach with joy His courts unto;
praise, laud, and bless His name always,
for it is seemly so to do.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Because the LORD our God is good,
His mercy is forever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood
and shall from age to age endure.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Praise God from whom all blessings flow;
praise Him, all creatures here below;
praise Him above, ye heav'nly host;
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!</lines>
		</verse>
