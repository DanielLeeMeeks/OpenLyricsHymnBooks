		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>May the mind of Christ, my Savior,
live in me from day to day,
by His love and pow'r controlling
all I do and say.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>May the Word of God dwell richly
in my heart from hour to hour,
so that all may see I triumph
only through His pow'r.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>May the peace of God, my Father,
rule my life in ev'rything,
that I may be calm to comfort
sick and sorrowing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>May the love of Jesus fill me
as the waters fill the sea.
Him exalting, self abasing:
this is victory.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>May I run the race before me,
strong and brave to face the foe,
looking only unto Jesus
as I onward go.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>May His beauty rest upon me
as I seek the lost to win,
and may they forget the channel,
seeing only Him.</lines>
		</verse>
