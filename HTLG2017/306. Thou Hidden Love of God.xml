		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Thou hidden Love of God, whose height,
whose depth unfathomed, no man knows,
I see from far Thy beauteous light,
and inly sigh for Thy repose;
my heart is pained, nor can it be
at rest till it finds rest in Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>'Tis mercy all that Thou hast brought
my mind to seek its peace in Thee;
yet, while I seek, but find Thee not,
no peace my wand'ring soul shall see.
O when shall all my wand'rings end,
and all my steps to Thee-ward tend?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Is there a thing beneath the sun
that strives with Thee my heart to share?
Ah! tear it thence, and reign alone,
the Lord of ev'ry motion there;
then shall my heart from earth be free,
when it has found repose in Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O hide this self from me, that I
no more, but Christ in me, may live;
my vile affections crucify,
nor let one darling lust survive;
in all things nothing may I see,
nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>O Love, Thy sov'reign aid impart
to save me from low-thoughted care;
chase this self-will from all my heart,
from all its hidden mazes there;
make me Thy duteous child, that I
may ceaseless "Abba, Father," cry.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Each moment draw from earth away
my heart, that lowly waits Thy call;
speak to my inmost soul, and say
"I am Thy Love, Thy God, Thy all."
To feel Thy pow'r, to hear Thy voice,
to taste Thy love, be all my choice!</lines>
		</verse>
