		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>As with gladness men of old
did the guiding star behold;
as with joy they hailed its light,
leading onward, beaming bright;
so, most gracious God, may we
evermore be led to Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>As with joyful steps they sped
to that lowly cradle-bed,
there to bend the knee before
Him whom heav'n and earth adore;
so may we with willing feet
ever seek Thy mercy-seat.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>As they offered gifts most rare
at that cradle rude and bare;
so may we with holy joy,
pure, and free from sinâ€™s alloy,
all our costliest treasures bring,
Christ, to Thee, our heav'nly King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Holy Jesus, ev'ry day
keep us in the narrow way;
and, when earthly things are past,
bring our ransomed lives at last
where they need no star to guide,
where no clouds Thy glory hide.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>In that heav'nly country bright
need they no created light;
Thou its Light, its Joy, its Crown,
Thou its Sun which goes not down;
there for ever may we sing
alleluias to our King.</lines>
		</verse>
