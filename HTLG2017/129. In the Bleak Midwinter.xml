	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
in the bleak midwinter, long ago.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
heav'n and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign:
in the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
the Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
but His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
worshiped the Beloved with a kiss.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
if I were a wise man, I would do my part;
yet what I can I give Him: give my heart.</lines>
		</verse>
