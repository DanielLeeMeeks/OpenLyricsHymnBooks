		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Stand up, and bless the Lord,
ye people of His choice;
stand up, and bless the Lord your God
with heart, and soul, and voice.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Tho' high above all praise,
above all blessing high,
who would not fear His holy Name,
and laud and magnify?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O for the living flame,
from His own altar brought,
to touch our lips, our mind inspire,
and wing to heav'n our thought!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There, with benign regard,
our hymns He deigns to hear;
though unrevealed to mortal sense,
the spirit feels Him near.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>God is our strength and song,
and His salvation ours;
then be His love in Christ proclaimed
with all our ransomed pow'rs.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Stand up and bless the Lord,
the Lord your God adore;
stand up, and bless His glorious Name
henceforth for evermore.</lines>
		</verse>
