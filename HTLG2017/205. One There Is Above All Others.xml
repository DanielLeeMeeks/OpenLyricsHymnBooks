		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>One there is, above all others,
well deserves the name of Friend;
His is love beyond a brother's,
costly, free, and knows no end;
they who once His kindness prove,
find it everlasting love!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Which of all our friends to save us,
could or would have shed their blood?
But our Jesus died to have us
reconciled in Him to God;
this was boundless love indeed!
Jesus is a Friend in need.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Men, when raised to lofty stations,
often know their friends no more;
slight and scorn their poor relations
though they valued them before.
But our Savior always owns
those whom He redeemed with groans.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>When He lived on earth abased,
Friend of sinners was His name;
now, above all glory raised,
He rejoices in the same;
still He calls them brethren, friends,
and to all their wants attends.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Could we bear from one another
what He daily bears from us?
Yet this glorious Friend and Brother
loves us though we treat Him thus;
though for good we render ill,
He accounts us brethren still.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>O for grace our hearts to soften!
Teach us, Lord, at length to love;
we, alas! forget too often
what a Friend we have above;
but when home our souls are brought,
we will love Thee as we ought.</lines>
		</verse>
