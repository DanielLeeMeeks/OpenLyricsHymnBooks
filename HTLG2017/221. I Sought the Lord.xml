	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I sought the Lord, and afterward I knew
He moved my soul to seek Him, seeking me;
it was not I that found, O Savior true;
no, I was found of Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Thou didst reach forth Thy hand and mine enfold;
I walked and sank not on the storm-vexed sea;
'twas not so much that I on Thee took hold,
as Thou, dear Lord, on me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I find, I walk, I love, but O, the whole
of love is but my answer, Lord, to Thee!
For Thou wert long beforehand with my soul,
always Thou lovedst me.</lines>
		</verse>
