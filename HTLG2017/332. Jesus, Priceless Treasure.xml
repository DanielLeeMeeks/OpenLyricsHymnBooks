		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus, priceless Treasure,
source of purest pleasure,
truest Friend to me;
Long my heart hath panted
till it well nigh fainted,
thirsting after Thee.
Thine I am, O spotless Lamb,
I will suffer nought to hid Thee,
ask for nought beside Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>In thine arms I rest me,
foes who would oppress me
cannot reach me here;
though the earth be shaking,
every heart be quaking,
Jesus calms my fear;
sin and hell in conflict fell
with their heaviest storms assail me.
Jesus will not fail me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Satan, I defy thee;
death, I need not fly thee;
fear, I bid thee cease!
Rage, O world, thy noises
cannot drown our voices
singing still of peace;
for God's pow'r guards every hour;
earth and all the depths adore Him,
silent bow before Him.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Wealth, I will not heed thee;
wherefore should I need thee?
Jesus is my joy;
honors, ye may glisten,
but I will not listen,
ye the soul destroy;
want or loss or shame or cross
ne'er to leave my Lord shall move me,
since He deigns to love me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Farewell, thou who choosest
earth, and heaven refuses,
thou wilt tempt in vain;
hence, ye sins, nor blind me,
get ye far behind me,
come not forth again:
past your hour, O pomp and power;
godless life, thy bonds I sever,
leave thee now for ever!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Hence, all thoughts sadness,
for the Lord of gladness,
Jesus, enters in;
those who love the Father,
though the storms may gather,
still have peace within;
yea, whate'er I here must bear,
Thou art still my purest pleasure,
Jesus, priceless Treasure!</lines>
