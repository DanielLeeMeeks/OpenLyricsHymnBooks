		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Our great High Priest is sitting
at God's right hand above,
for us His hands uplifting
in sympathy and love;
whilst here below, in weakness,
we onward speed our way,
in sorrow oft and sickness,
we sigh, and groan, and pray.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Through manifold temptation,
my soul holds on its course;
Christ's mighty intercession
alone is my resource;
my gracious High Priest's pleadings,
who on the cross did bleed,
bring own God's grace and blessings
and help in hour of need.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>'Twas God's most gracious favor
that gave His Son to die,
to live our Intercessor,
to plead for us on high.
O Jesus, blessed Savior,
who soon for us will come,
redemption's work completed,
our battle fought, and won.</lines>
		</verse>
