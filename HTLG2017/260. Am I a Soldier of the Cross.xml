		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Am I a soldier of the cross,
a foll'wer of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause
or blush to speak His Name?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Must I be carried to the skies
on flow'ry beds of ease,
while others fought to win the prize
and sailed through bloody seas?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace
to help me on to God?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
increase my courage, Lord;
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
supported by Thy Word.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Thy saints in all this glorious war
shall conquer, though they die;
they see the triumph from afar
by faith's discerning eye.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>When that illustrious day shall rise,
and all Thine armies shine
in robes of vict'ry through the skies,
the glory shall be Thine.</lines>
		</verse>
