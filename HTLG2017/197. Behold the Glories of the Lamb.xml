		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Behold the glories of the Lamb
amidst His Father's throne!
amidst His Father's throne!
Prepare new honors for His name,
and songs before unknown,
and songs before unknown.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Let elders worship at His feet,
the church adore around,
the church adore around,
with vials full of odors sweet,
and harps of sweeter sound,
and harps of sweeter sound.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Now to the Lamb that once was slain
be endless blessings paid;
be endless blessings paid;
salvation, glory, joy, remain
forever on Thy head,
forever on Thy head.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Thou hast redeemed our souls with blood,
hast set the pris'ners free,
hast set the prisoners free,
hast made us kings and priests to God,
and we shall reign with Thee,
and we shall reign with Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
