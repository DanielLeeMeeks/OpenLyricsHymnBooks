		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The head that once was crowned with thorns
is crowned with glory now;
a royal diadem adorns
the mighty Victor's brow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The highest place that heav'n affords
is His, is His by right,
the King of kings and Lord of lords,
and heav'n's eternal Light.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The joy of all who dwell above,
the joy of all below,
to whom He manifests His love,
and grants His name to know.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>To them the cross with all its shame,
with all its grace, is giv'n,
their name, an everlasting name,
their joy, the joy of heav'n.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>They suffer with their Lord below,
they reign with Him above,
their profit and their joy to know
the myst'ry of His love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>The cross He bore is life and health,
though shame and death to Him:
His people's Hope, His people's Wealth,
their everlasting Theme!</lines>
		</verse>
