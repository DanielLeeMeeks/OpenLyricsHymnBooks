		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus! what a Friend for sinners!
Jesus! Lover of my soul;
friends may fail me, foes assail me,
He, my Savior makes me whole.
Hallelujah! what a Savior!
Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
He is with me to the end.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus! what a Strength in weakness!
Let me hide myself in Him;
tempted, tried, and sometimes failing,
He, my Strength, my vict'ry wins.
Hallelujah! what a Savior!
Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
He is with me to the end.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Jesus! what a Help in sorrow!
While the billows o'er me roll,
even when my heart is breaking,
He, my Comfort, helps my soul.
Hallelujah! what a Savior!
Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
He is with me to the end.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Jesus! what a Guide and Keeper!
While the tempest still is high,
storms about me, night o'er takes me,
He, my Pilot hears my cry.
Hallelujah! what a Savior!
Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
He is with me to the end.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Jesus! I do now receive Him,
more than all in Him I find;
He hath granted me forgiveness,
I am His, and He is mine.
Hallelujah! what a Savior!
Hallelujah! what a Friend!
Saving, helping, keeping, loving,
He is with me to the end.</lines>
