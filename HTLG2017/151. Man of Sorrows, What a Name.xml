		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>"Man of Sorrows," what a name
for the Son of God who came
ruined sinners to reclaim!
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
in my place condemned He stood,
sealed my pardon with His blood;
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Guilty, vile, and helpless we;
spotless Lamb of God was He;
full atonement, can it be?
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Lifted up was He to die,
"It is finished," was His cry;
now in heav'n exalted high'
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>When He comes, our glorious King,
all His ransomed home to bring,
then anew this song we'll sing:
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
