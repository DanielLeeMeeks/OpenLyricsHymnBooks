		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Soldiers of Christ, arise,
and put your armor on,
strong in the strength which God supplies
through His eternal Son;
strong in the Lord of hosts
and in His mighty pow'r,
who in the strength of Jesus trusts
is more than conqueror.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Stand then in His great might,
with all His strength endued,
and take, to aid you in the fight,
the panoply of God.
From strength to strength go on,
wrestle and fight and pray;
tread all the pow'rs of darkness down
and win the well-fought day.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Leave no unguarded place,
no weakness of the soul;
take ev'ry virtue, ev'ry grace,
and fortify the whole.
That, having all things done
and all your conflicts past,
ye may o'ercome through Christ alone
and stand complete at last.</lines>
		</verse>
