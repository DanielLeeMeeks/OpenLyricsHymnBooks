		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Praise the Lord who reigns above
and keeps His courts below;
praise the holy God of love,
and all His greatness show.
Praise Him for His noble deeds,
praise Him for His matchless pow'r;
Him from whom all good proceeds
let earth and heaven adore.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Celebrate th'eternal God
with harp and psaltery;
timbrels soft and cymbals loud
in His high praise agree.
Praise Him, ev'ry tuneful string;
all the reach of heav'nly art,
all the pow'rs of music bring,
the music of the heart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Him, in whom they move and live,
let ev'ry creature sing,
glory to their Maker give,
and homage to their King.
Hallowed be His name beneath,
as in heav'n, on earth adored;
praise the Lord in ev'ry breath,
let all things praise the LORD!</lines>
		</verse>
