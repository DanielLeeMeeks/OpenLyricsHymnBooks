		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Now thank we all our God
with heart and hands and voices,
who wondrous things has done,
in whom His world rejoices;
who, from our mothers' arms,
has blessed us on our way
with countless gifts of love,
and still is ours today.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O may this bounteous God
through all our life be near us,
with ever joyful hearts
and blessed peace to cheer us;
to keep us in His grace,
and guide us when perplexed,
and free us from all woes
in this world and the next.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>All praise and thanks to God
the Father now be given,
the Son, and Him who reigns
with Them in highest heaven,
the one eternal God,
whom earth and heav'n adore,
for so it was, is now,
and shall be evermore.</lines>
		</verse>
