		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Lord Jesus, think on me,
and purge away my sin;
from earth-born passions set me free,
and make me pure within.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Lord Jesus, think on me,
with care and woe oppressed,
let me Thy loving servant be,
and taste Thy promised rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Lord Jesus, think on me,
nor let me go astray;
through darkness and perplexity
point Thou the heav'nly way.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Lord Jesus, think on me,
that, when the flood is past,
I may eternal brightness see,
and share Thy joy at last.</lines>
		</verse>
