		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Built on the Rock, the church shall stand
even when steeples are falling;
Christ builds His church in ev'ry land;
bells still are chiming and calling,
calling the young and old to rest,
calling the souls of those distressed,
longing for life everlasting.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Not in a temple made with hands
God the Almighty is dwelling;
high in the heav'ns His temple stands,
all earthly temples excelling.
Yet He who dwells in heaven above
chooses to live with us in love,
making our body His temple.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>We are God's house of living stones,
built for His own habitation;
He fills our hearts, His humble thrones,
granting us life and salvation.
Yet to the place, an earthly frame,
we come with thanks to praise His name;
God grants His people true blessing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Thro' all the passing years, O Lord,
grant that, when church bells are ringing,
many may come to hear God's Word
where He the promise is bringing:
"I know My own, My own know Me,
you, not the world, My face shall see;
My peace I leave with you. Amen."</lines>
		</verse>
