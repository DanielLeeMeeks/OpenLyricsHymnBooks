		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
great David's greater Son!
Hail, in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
to set the captive free,
to take away transgression,
and rule in equity.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He comes with succor speedy
to those who suffer wrong;
to help the poor and needy,
and bid the weak be strong;
to give them songs for sighing,
their darkness turn to light,
whose souls, condemned and dying,
are precious in His sight.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He shall come down like showers
upon the fruitful earth;
and love, joy, hope, like flowers,
spring in His path to birth;
Before Him on the mountains
shall peace, the herald, go,
and righteousness, in fountains,
from hill to valley flow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Arabia's desert ranger
to Him shall bow the knee,
the Ethiopian stranger
His glory come to see;
with offerings of devotion,
ships from the isles shall meet,
to pour the wealth of ocean
in tribute at His feet.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Kings shall fall down before Him,
and gold and incense bring;
all nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing;
for He shall have dominion
o'er river, sea, and shore,
far as the eagle's pinion
or dove's light wing can soar.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>For Him shall pray'r unceasing,
and daily vows ascend;
His kingdom still increasing,
a kingdom without end;
the mountain dews shall nourish
a seed in weakness sown,
whose fruit shall spread and flourish,
and shake like Lebanon.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>O'er every foe victorious,
He on His throne shall rest,
from age to age more glorious,
all-blessing and all-blessed;
the tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His name shall stand forever -
that name to us is Love.</lines>
		</verse>
