		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>It is a thing most wonderful,
almost too wonderful to be,
that God's own Son should come from heav'n,
and die to save a child like me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>And yet I know that it is true:
He chose a poor and humble lot,
and wept and toiled and mourned and died
for love of those who loved Him not.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I cannot tell how He could love
a child so weak and full of sin;
His love must be most wonderful
if He could die my love to win.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I sometimes think about the cross,
and shut my eyes, and try to see
the cruel nails and crown of thorns,
and Jesus crucified for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>But even could I see Him die,
I could but see a little part
of that great love which, like a fire,
is always burning in His heart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>It is most wonderful to know
His love for me so free and sure;
but 'tis more wonderful to see
my love for him so faint and poor.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v7">
			<lines>And yet I want to love Thee, Lord;
O light the flame within my heart,
and I will love Thee more and more,
until I see Thee as Thou art.</lines>
		</verse>
