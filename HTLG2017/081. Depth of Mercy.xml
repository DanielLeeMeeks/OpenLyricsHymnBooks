		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Depth of mercy! Can there be
mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear?
Me, the chief of sinners, spare?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I have long withstood His grace:
long provoked Him to His face;
would not hearken to His calls;
grieved Him by a thousand falls.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I my Master have denied,
I afresh have crucified,
oft profaned His hallowed name,
put Him to an open shame.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There for me the Savior stands,
shows His wounds and spreads His hands:
God is love! I know, I feel;
Jesus weeps, but loves me still!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Now incline me to repent!
Let me now my fall lament!
Now my foul revolt deplore!
Weep, believe, and sin no more.</lines>
		</verse>
