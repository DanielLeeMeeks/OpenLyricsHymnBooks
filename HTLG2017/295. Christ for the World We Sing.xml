		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Christ for the world we sing;
the world to Christ we bring
with loving zeal;
the poor and them that mourn,
the faint and overborne,
sin-sick and sorrow-worn,
for Christ doth heal.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Christ for the world we sing;
the world to Christ we bring
with fervent pray'r;
the wayward and the lost,
by restless passions tossed,
redeemed at countless cost
from dark despair.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Christ for the world we sing;
the world to Christ we bring
with one accord;
with us the work to share,
with us reproach to dare,
with us the cross to bear,
for Christ our Lord.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Christ for the world we sing;
the world to Christ we bring
with joyful song;
the newborn souls whose days,
reclaimed from error's ways,
inspired with hope and praise,
to Christ belong.</lines>
		</verse>
