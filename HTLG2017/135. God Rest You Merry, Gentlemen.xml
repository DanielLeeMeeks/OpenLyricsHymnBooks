		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>God rest you merry, gentlemen,
let nothing you dismay,
remember Christ our Savior
was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
when we were gone astray.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>From God our heav'nly Father
a blessed angel came
and unto certain shepherds
brought tidings of the same;
how that in Bethlehem was born
the son of God by name.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"Fear not," then said the angel,
"Let nothing you affright;
this day is born a Savior
of a pure virgin bright,
to free all those who trust in Him
from Satan's pow'r and might."
O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Now to the Lord sing praises
all you within this place,
and with true love and brotherhood
each other new embrace;
this holy tide of Christmas
all other doth deface.
O tidings of comfort and joy,
comfort and joy;
O tidings of comfort and joy.</lines>
		</verse>
