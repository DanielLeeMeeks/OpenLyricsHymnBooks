		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,
and publish abroad His wonderful Name;
the Name all-victorious of Jesus extol;
His kingdom is glorious; He rules over all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>God rules in the height, almighty to save;
though hid from our sight, His presence we have;
the great congregation His triumph shall sing,
ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"Salvation to God, who sits on the throne!"
Let all cry aloud, and honor the Son;
the praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,
fall down on their faces and worship the Lamb.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>So let us adore and give Him His right:
all glory and pow'r, all wisdom and might,
all honor and blessing, with angels above,
and praises unceasing for infinite love.</lines>
		</verse>
