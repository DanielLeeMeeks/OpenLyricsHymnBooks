		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When peace like a river attendeth my way,
when sorrows like sea billows roll,
whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
"It is well, it is well with my soul."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>It is well with my soul;
it is well, it is well with my soul!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
let this blest assurance control:
that Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
and has shed his own blood for my soul. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>My sin--oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part, but the whole,
is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;
praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
the trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend;
even so, it is well with my soul. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
