	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come to the waters, whoever is thirsty;
drink from the Fountain that never runs dry.
Jesus, the Living One, offers you mercy,
life more abundant in boundless supply.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Come to the River that flows through the city,
forth from the throne of the Father and Son.
Jesus the Savior says, "Come and drink deeply."
Drink from the pure, inexhaustible One.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Come to the Fountain without any money;
buy what is given without any cost.
Jesus, the gracious One, welcomes the weary;
Jesus, the selfless One died for the lost.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Come to the Well of unmerited favor;
stretch out your hand; fill your cup to the brim.
Jesus is such a compassionate Savior.
Draw from the grace that flows freely from Him.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Come to the Savior, the God of salvation.
God has provided an end to sin's strife.
Why will you suffer the Law's condemnation?
Take the free gift of the water of life.</lines>
		</verse>
