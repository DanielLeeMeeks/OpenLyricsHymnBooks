		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Praise the Savior, ye who know Him!
Who can tell how much we owe Him?
Gladly let us render to Him
all we are and have.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus is the name that charms us;
He for conflict fits and arms us;
nothing moves and nothing harms us
while we trust in Him.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Trust in Him, ye saints, forever;
He is faithful, changing never;
neither force nor guile can sever
those He loves from Him.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Keep us, Lord, O keep us cleaving
to Thyself, and still believing,
till the hour of our receiving
promised joys with Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Then we shall be where we would be,
then we shall be what we should be;
things that are not now, nor could be,
soon shall be our own.</lines>
		</verse>
