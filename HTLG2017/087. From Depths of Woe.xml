		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>From depths of woe I cry to Thee;
Lord, hear me, I implore Thee.
Bend down Thy gracious ear to me;
my pray'r let come before Thee.
If Thou rememb'rest every sin,
if nought but just reward we win,
could we abide Thy presence?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Thy love and grace alone avail
to blot out my transgression;
the best and holiest deeds must fail
to break sin's dread oppression.
Before Thee none can boasting stand,
but all must fear Thy strict demand
and live alone by mercy.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Therefore my hope is in the LORD
and not in mine own merit;
it rests upon His faithful Word
to them of contrite spirit
that He is merciful and just;
this is my comfort and my trust.
His help I wait with patience.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>And though it tarry till the night
and till the morning waken,
my heart shall never doubt His might
nor count itself forsaken.
Do thus, O ye of Adam's seed,
ye of the Spirit born indeed;
wait for your God's appearing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Though great our time and sore our woes,
His grace much more aboundeth;
His helping love on emit knows,
or utmost need it soundeth.
Our Shepherd good and true is He,
who will at last His people free
from all their sin and sorrow.</lines>
		</verse>
