		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O Lord, how shall I meet You,
how welcome You aright?
Your people long to greet You,
my Hope, my heartâ€™s Delight!
O, kindle, Lord most holy,
Your lamp within my breast
to do in spirit lowly
all that may please You best.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Love caused Your incarnation;
love brought You down to me.
Your thirst for my salvation
procured my liberty.
O, love beyond all telling,
that led You to embrace
in love, all love excelling,
our lost and fallen race.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Rejoice, then, you sad-hearted,
who sit in deepest gloom,
who mourn your joys departed
and tremble at your doom.
Despair not; He is near you,
there, standing at the door,
who best can help and cheer you
and bids you weep no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Sin's debt, that fearful burden,
let not your soul distress;
your guilt the Lord will pardon
and cover by His grace.
He comes, former procuring
the peace of sin forgiv'n,
for all God's ons securing
their heritage in heav'n.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>He comes to judge the nations,
a terror to His foes,
a light of consolations
and blessed hope to those
who love the Lord's appearing.
O glorious Sun, now come,
send forth Your beams most cheering
and guide us safely home.</lines>
