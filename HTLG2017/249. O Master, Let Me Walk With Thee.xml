		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O Master, let me walk with Thee
in lowly paths of service free;
tell me Thy secret; help me bear
the strain of toil, the fret of care.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Help me the slow of heart to move
by some clear, winning word of love;
teach me the wayward feet to stay,
and guide them in the homeward way.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Teach me Thy patience, still with Thee
in closer, dearer company,
in work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
in trust that triumphs over wrong.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>In hope that sends a shining ray
far down the future's broad'ning way;
in peace that only Thou canst give,
with Thee, O Master, let me live.</lines>
		</verse>
