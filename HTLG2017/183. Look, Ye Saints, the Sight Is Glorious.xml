		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious:
see the Man of Sorrows now;
from the fight returned victorious,
ev'ry knee to Him shall bow.
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crowns become the Victor's brow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Crown the Savior, angels, crown Him;
rich the trophies Jesus brings;
in the seat of pow'r enthrone Him,
while the vault of heaven rings:
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown the Savior King of kings!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Sinners in derision crowned Him,
mocking thus the Savior's claim;
saints and angels crowd around Him,
sing His title, praise His name.
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Spread abroad the Victor's fame!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Hark, those bursts of acclamation!
Hark! those loud triumphant chords!
Jesus takes the highest station;
O what joy the sight affords!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
King of kings, and Lord of lords!</lines>
		</verse>
