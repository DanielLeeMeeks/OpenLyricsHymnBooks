		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>’Tis midnight; and on Olive’s brow
the star is dimmed that lately shone:
’tis midnight; in the garden now
the suff'ring Savior prays alone.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>’Tis midnight; and, from all removed,
Emmanuel wrestles lone with fears:
e’en the disciple that He loved
heeds not his Master’s grief and tears.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>’Tis midnight; and, for others’ guilt,
the Man of Sorrows weeps in blood:
yet He that has in anguish knelt
is not forsaken by His God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>’Tis midnight; and from heav'nly plains
is borne the song that angels know:
unheard by mortals are the strains
that sweetly soothe the Savior’s woe.</lines>
		</verse>
