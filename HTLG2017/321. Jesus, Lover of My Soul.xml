		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus, lover of my soul,
let me to Thy bosom fly,
while the nearer waters roll,
while the tempest still is high;
hide me, O my Savior, hide,
till the storm of life is past;
safe into the haven guide;
O receive my soul at last.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Other refuge have I none;
hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
leave, ah, leave me not alone,
still support and comfort me;
all my trust on Thee is stayed,
all my help from Thee I bring;
cover my defenceless head
with the shadow of Thy wing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
more than all in Thee I find;
raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
heal the sick, and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy Name,
I am all unrighteousness!
Vile and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
grace to cover all my sin;
let the healing streams abound,
make and keep me pure within;
Thou of life the Fountain art,
freely let me take of Thee,
spring Thou up within my heart,
rise to all eternity.</lines>
		</verse>
