		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Gentle Mary laid her Child
lowly in a manger;
there He lay, the undefiled,
to the world a stranger;
such a Babe in such a place,
can He be the Savior?
Ask the saved of all the race
who have found His favor.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Angels sang about His birth;
wise men sought and found Him;
heavenâ€™s star shone brightly forth,
glory all around Him;
shepherds saw the wondrous sight,
heard the angels singing;
all the plains were lit that night,
all the hills were ringing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Gentle Mary laid her Child
lowly in a manger;
He is still the undefiled,
but no more a stranger;
Son of God, of humble birth,
beautiful the story;
praise His name in all the earth;
hail the King of glory!</lines>
		</verse>
