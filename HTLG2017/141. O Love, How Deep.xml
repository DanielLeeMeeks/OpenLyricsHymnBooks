		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O love, how deep, how broad, how high,
how passing thought and fantasy,
that God, the Son of God, should take
our mortal form for mortals’ sake!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He sent no angel to our race,
of higher or of lower place,
but wore the robe of human frame,
and He Himself to this world came.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>For us baptized, for us He bore
His holy fast, and hungered sore;
for us temptations sharp He knew,
for us the tempter overthrew.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>For us to wicked men betrayed,
scourged, mocked, in crown of thorns arrayed,
He bore the shameful cross and death
for us at length gave up His breath.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>For us He rose from death again,
for us He went on high to reign,
for us He sent His Spirit here
to guide, to strengthen, and to cheer.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>All glory to our Lord and God
for love so deep, so high, so broad —
the Trinity whom we adore
forever and forevermore.</lines>
		</verse>
