		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The perfect righteousness of God
is witnessed in the Savior's blood;
'tis the cross of Christ we trace
His righteousness, yet wondrous grace.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>God could not pass the sinner by;
justice demands that he should die;
but in the cross of Christ we see
how God can save, yet righteous be.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The judgment fell on Jesus' head;
'twas in His blood sin's debt was paid;
stern Justice can demand no more,
and Mercy can dispense her store.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The sinner who believes is free,
can say, "The Savior died for me";
can point to the atoning blood
and say, "This made my peace with God."</lines>
		</verse>
