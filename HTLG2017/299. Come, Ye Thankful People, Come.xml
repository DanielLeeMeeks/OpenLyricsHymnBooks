		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come, ye thankful people, come;
raise the song of harvest home.
All is safely gathered in
ere the winter storms begin.
God, our Maker, doth provide
for our wants to be supplied;
come to God's own temple, come,
raise the song of harvest home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>All the world is God's own field,
fruit unto His praise to yield.
wheat and tares together sown,
unto joy or sorrow grown.
First the blade, and then the ear,
then the full corn shall appear,
Lord of harvest, grant that we
wholesome grain and pure may be.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>For the Lord our God shall come,
and shall take His harvest home;
from His field shall in that day
all offenses purge away,
give His angels charge at last
in the fire the tares to cast,
but the fruitful ears to store
in His garner evermore.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Even so, Lord, quickly come
to Thy final harvest home;
gather Thou Thy people in,
free from sorrow, free from sin,
there forever purified,
in Thy presence to abide.
Come, with all Thine angels, come,
raise the glorious harvest home.</lines>
		</verse>
