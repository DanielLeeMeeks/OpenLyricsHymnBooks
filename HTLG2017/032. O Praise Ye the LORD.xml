		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O praise ye the LORD
and sing a new song,
amid all the saints
His praises prolong;
the praise of their Maker
His people shall sing,
and children of Zion
rejoice in their King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>With timbrel and harp
and joyful acclaim,
with gladness and mirth,
sing praise to His Name;
for God in His people
His pleasure doth seek,
with robes of salvation
He clotheth the meek.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>In glory exult,
ye saints of the LORD;
with songs in the night
high praises accord;
go forth in His service,
be strong in His might
to conquer all evil
and stand for the right.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>For this is His word:
His saints shall not fail,
but over the earth
their pow'r shall prevail;
all kingdoms and nations
shall yield to their sway.
to God give the glory
and praise Him for aye.</lines>
		</verse>
