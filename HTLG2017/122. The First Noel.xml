		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The first noel the angel did say
was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay,
in fields where they lay keeping their sheep
on a cold winter's night that was so deep.
Noel, noel, noel, noel!
Born is the King of Israel!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>They look√®d up and saw a star
shining in the east, beyond them far;
and to the earth it gave great light,
and so it continued both day and night.
Noel, noel, noel, noel!
Born is the King of Israel!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>And by the light of that same star,
three wise men came from country far;
to seek for a king was their intent,
and to follow the star wherever it went.
Noel, noel, noel, noel!
Born is the King of Israel!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>This star drew nigh to the northwest,
over Bethlehem it took its rest;
and there it did both stop and stay
right over the place where Jesus lay.
Noel, noel, noel, noel!
Born is the King of Israel!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Then entered in those wise men three,
full rev'rently upon their knee,
and offered there in His presence,
their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.
Noel, noel, noel, noel!
Born is the King of Israel!</lines>
		</verse>
