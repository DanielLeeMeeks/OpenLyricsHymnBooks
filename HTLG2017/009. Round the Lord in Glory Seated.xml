		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Round the Lord in glory seated,
cherubim and seraphim
filled his temple, and repeated
each to each th'alternate hymn:
"Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
earth is with its fullness stored;
unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Heav'n is still with glory ringing;
earth takes up the angels' cry,
"Holy, holy, holy," singing,
"Lord of hosts, the Lord Most High!"
"Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
earth is with its fullness stored;
unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>With His seraph-train before Him,
With His holy Church below,
thus conspire we to adore Him,
bid we thus our anthem flow:
"Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
earth is with its fullness stored;
unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Thus Thy glorious name confessing,
with Thine angel hosts we cry,
"Holy, holy, holy," blessing
Thee, the Lord of Hosts Most High.
"Lord, Thy glory fills the heaven,
earth is with its fullness stored;
unto Thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord."</lines>
		</verse>
