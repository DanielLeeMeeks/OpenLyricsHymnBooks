		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform;
He plants His footsteps in the sea
and rides upon the storm.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Deep in unfathomable mines
of never-failing skill;
He treasures up his bright designs,
and works His sov'reign will.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
the clouds you so much dread
are big with mercy and shall break
in blessings on your head.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
but trust Him for His grace;
behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>His purposes will ripen fast,
unfolding ev'ry hour;
the bud may have a bitter taste,
but sweet will be the flow'r.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Blind unbelief is sure to err,
and scan His work in vain;
God is His own interpreter,
and He will make it plain.</lines>
		</verse>
