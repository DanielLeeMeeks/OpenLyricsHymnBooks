		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>To avert from men God’s wrath,
Jesus suffered in our stead;
by an ignominious death
He a full atonement made;
and by His most precious blood
brought us, sinners, nigh to God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Christ bids each afflicted soul,
"Come that I may soothe your grief.
No one who is strong and whole
needs a doctor for relief;
therefore have no fear, draw nigh,
that your want I may supply."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>But examine first your case,
whether you be in the faith;
do you long for pard’ning grace?
Is your only hope His death?
Then, how e’er your soul’s oppressed,
come, you are a worthy guest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>They who Jesus’ mercy knows
are from wrath and envy freed;
love unto our neighbor shows
that we are His flock indeed;
thus we may in all our ways
show forth our Redeemer’s praise.</lines>
		</verse>
