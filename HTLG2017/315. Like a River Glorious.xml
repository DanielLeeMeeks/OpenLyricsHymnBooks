		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Like a river glorious is Godâ€™s perfect peace,
over all victorious in its bright increase;
perfect, yet it floweth fuller ev'ry day;
perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest;
finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,
never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Ev'ry joy or trial falleth from above,
traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love;
we may trust Him fully all for us to do;
they who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
