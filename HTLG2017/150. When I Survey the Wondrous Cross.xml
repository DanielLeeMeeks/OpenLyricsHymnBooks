		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of Glory died,
my richest gain I count but loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>See from His head, His hands, His feet,
sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were a present far too small;
love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all.</lines>
		</verse>
