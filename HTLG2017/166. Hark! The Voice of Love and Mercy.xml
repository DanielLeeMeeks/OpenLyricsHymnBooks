		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Hark! the voice of love and mercy
sounds aloud from Calvary;
see, it rends the rocks asunder,
shakes the earth, and veils the sky:
"It is finished!
It is finished!
It is finished!"
Hear the dying Savior cry;
hear the dying Savior cry.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>"It is finished!" O what pleasure
do these precious words afford;
heav'nly blessings, without measure,
flow to us from Christ the Lord:
"It is finished!
It is finished!
It is finished!"
Saints, the dying words record;
saints, the dying words record.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Finished all the types and shadows
of the ceremonial law;
finished all that God had promised;
death and hell no more shall awe:
"It is finished!
It is finished!
It is finished!"
Saints, from hence your comfort draw;
saints, from hence your comfort draw.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Tune your harps anew, ye seraphs,
join to sing the glorious theme;
all in earth, and all in heaven,
join to praise Emmanuel's Name:
Alleluia!
Alleluia!
Alleluia!
Glory to the bleeding Lamb!
Glory to the bleeding Lamb!</lines>
		</verse>
