		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Our God, our Help in ages past,
our Hope for years to come,
our Shelter from the stormy blast,
and our eternal Home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
sufficient is Thine arm alone,
and our defense is sure.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Before the hills in order stood
or earth received its frame,
from everlasting Thou art God,
to endless years the same.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>A thousand ages in Thy sight
are like an ev'ning gone,
short as the watch that ends the night
before the rising sun.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
bears all its sons away;
they fly forgotten, as a dream
dies at the op'ning day.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Our God, our Help in ages past,
our Hope for years to come,
be Thou our Guide while life shall last,
and our eternal Home!</lines>
		</verse>
