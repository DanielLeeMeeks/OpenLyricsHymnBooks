		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>From heav'n above to earth I come,
to bear good news to ev'ry home;
glad tidings of great joy I bring
whereof I now will say and sing:</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>To you, this night, is born a Child
of Mary, chosen mother mild;
this tender Child of lowly birth
shall be the joy of all the earth.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>'Tis Christ our God, who far on high
had heard your sad and bitter cry;
Himself will your Salvation be,
Himself from sin will make you free.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Now let us all, with gladsome cheer,
follow the shepherds, and draw near
to see this wondrous Gift of God,
who hath His own dear Son bestowed.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Glory to God in highest heav'n,
who unto us His Son has giv'n,
while angels sing, with pious mirth,
a glad New Year to all the earth.</lines>
		</verse>
