		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O Thou, in whose presence my soul takes delight,
on whom in affliction I call,
my Comfort by day and my Song in the night,
my Hope, my Salvation, my All.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Where dost Thou, dear Shepherd, resort with Thy sheep,
to feed them in pastures of love?
Say, why in the valley of death should I weep,
or alone in this wilderness rove?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O why should I wander, an alien from Thee,
or cry in the desert for bread?
Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,
and smile at the tears I have shed.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>He looks! and ten thousands of angels rejoice,
and myriads wait for His word;
He speaks! and eternity, filled with His voice,
Re-echoes the praise of the Lord.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Dear Shepherd! I hear, and will follow Thy call;
I know the sweet sound of Thy voice;
restore and defend me, for Thou art my All,
And in Thee I will ever rejoice.</lines>
		</verse>
