		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Christ is coming! Let creation
from her groans and travail cease;
let the glorious proclamation
hope restore and faith increase;
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace,
come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Earth can now but tell the story
Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
she shall yet behold Thy glory,
When Thou comest back to reign:
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Let each heart repeat the strain,
let each heart repeat the strain.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Long Thine exiles have been pining,
far from rest, and home, and Thee;
but, in heav'nly vestures shining,
they their loving Lord shall see:
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Haste the joyous jubilee,
haste the joyous jubilee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>With that blessed hope before us,
let no harp remain unstrung;
let the mighty advent chorus
onward roll from tongue to tongue:
"Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come,
come, Lord Jesus, quickly come!"</lines>
		</verse>
