		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come down, O Love divine,
seek Thou this soul of mine,
and visit it with Thine own ardor glowing;
O Comforter, draw near,
within my heart appear,
and kindle it, Thy holy flame bestowing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O let it freely burn,
till earthly passions turn
to dust and ashes in its heat consuming;
and let Thy glorious light
shine ever on my sight,
and clothe me round, the while my path illuming.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Let holy charity
mine outward vesture be,
and lowliness become mine inner clothing:
true lowliness of heart,
which takes the humbler part,
and o'er its own shortcomings weeps with loathing.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>And so the yearning strong,
with which the soul will long,
shall far outpass the pow'r of human telling;
no soul can guess its grace,
till he become the place
wherein the Holy Spirit makes His dwelling.</lines>
		</verse>
