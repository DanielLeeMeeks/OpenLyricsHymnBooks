		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus, my highest treasure,
in Thy communion blest
I find unfailing pleasure,
true happiness and rest;
myself a willing off'ring
I give to Thee alone,
because by death and suff'ring
Thou didst for me atone.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O Joy, all joys excelling,
the Bread of Life Thou art,
Thou cam'st to make Thy dwelling
in my unworthy heart.
My spirit’s hungry craving
Thou canst forever still;
from deepest anguish saving,
with bliss my cup canst fill.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O let my eyes be lightened
by sight of Thy dear face;
my life below be brightened
by tasting of Thy grace;
without Thee, mighty Savior,
to live is nought but pain;
to have Thy love and favor
is happiness and gain.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Earth’s glory to inherit
is not what I desire;
to heav'n aspires my spirit,
glowing with nobler fire.
Where Christ Himself appeareth
in brightest majesty,
for me a place prepareth there,
there, there I long to be.</lines>
		</verse>
