		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>A good High Priest is come,
supplying Aaron's place,
and taking up his room,
dispensing life and grace;
the law by Aaron's priesthood came,
but grace and truth by Jesus' name.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He once temptations knew
of every sort and kind,
that He might succor show
to every tempted mind;
in every point the Lamb was tried
like us, and then for us He died.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He died, but lives again,
and by the throne He stands,
there shows how He was slain,
opening His pierc√®d hands;
our Priest abides and pleads the cause
of us who have transgressed His laws.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I other priests disclaim,
and laws and off'rings too;
none but the bleeding Lamb
the mighty work can do;
He shall have all the praise: for He
has loved, and died, and lives for me.</lines>
		</verse>
