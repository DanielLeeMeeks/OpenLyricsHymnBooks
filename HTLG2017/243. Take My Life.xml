		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Take my life, and let it be
consecrated, Lord, to Thee.
Take my moments and my days,
let them flow in endless praise,
let them flow in endless praise.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Take my hands, and let them move
at the impulse of Thy love.
Take my feet, and let them be
swift and beautiful for Thee,
swift and beautiful for Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Take my voice and let me sing
always, only for my King.
Take my lips, and let them be
filled with messages from Thee,
filled with messages from Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Take my silver and my gold;
not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect, and use
ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose,
ev'ry pow'r as Thou shalt choose.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Take my will and make it Thine;
it shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart, it is Thine own;
it shall be Thy royal throne,
it shall be Thy royal throne.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Take my love, my Lord, I pour
at Thy feet its treasure store;
take myself, and I will be
ever, only, all for Thee,
ever, only, all for Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
