		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord
God of hosts, Eternal King,
by the heav'ns and earth adored!
Angels and archangels sing,
chanting everlastingly
to the blessed Trinity.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Since by Thee were all things made,
and in Thee do all things live,
be to Thee all honor paid;
praise to Thee let all things give,
singing everlastingly
To the blessed Trinity.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Thousands, tens of thousands stand,
spirits blest before Thy throne,
speeding thence at Thy command;
and, when Thy command is done,
singing everlastingly
to the blessed Trinity.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Cherubim and seraphim
veil their faces with their wings;
eyes of angels are too dim
to behold the King of kings,
while they sing eternally
to the blessed Trinity.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Thee, apostles, prophets, Thee,
Thee, the noble martyr band,
praise with solemn jubilee,
Thee, the Church in ev'ry land;
singing everlastingly
to the blessed Trinity.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Alleluia! Lord, to Thee,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
Three in One, and One in Three,
join we with the heav'enly host,
singing everlastingly
to the blessed Trinity.</lines>
