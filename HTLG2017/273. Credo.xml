		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Yes, I believe in Him
who is almighty Father, God,
who made all things in heaven, earth,
who made them very good.
Yes, I believe in Jesus Christ,
God's only Son, our Lord,
begotten by the Spirit
and of Virgin Mary born.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Who under Pontius Pilate's hand
was scorned and suffered grief;
who then was crucified and, dead,
laid in a borrowed grave;
who from descent to depths of earth
the third day rose again,
ascended into heaven
where He sits at God's right hand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>From there one day He will return
to judge the souls of men;
the small and great, living and dead,
must all before Him stand.
Yes, I believe the Holy Ghost
is very God who calls
the penitent to His true church,
where each communes with all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Yes, I believe God does forgive
the sins of those who come
to Him confessing Jesus Lord
and trusting in His name.
Yes, I believe the righteous dead
Christ's resurrection share,
that blessed life with Him for all
eternity is theirs.</lines>
		</verse>
