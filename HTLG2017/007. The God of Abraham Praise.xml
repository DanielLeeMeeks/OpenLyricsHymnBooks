		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The God of Abr'ham praise,
who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of eternal days,
and God of love!
Jehovah, great I AM,
by earth and heav'n confessed
I bow and bless the sacred Name
forever blest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The God of Abr'ham praise,
at whose supreme command
from earth I rise, and seek the joys
at His right hand.
I all on earth forsake,
its wisdom, fame, and pow'r,
and Him my only Portion make,
my Shield and Tow'r.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He by Himself hath sworn,
I on His oath depend;
I shall, on eagles' wings upborne,
to heaven ascend,
I shall behold His face,
I shall His pow'r adore,
and sign the wonders of His grace
forevermore.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>He keeps His own secure,
He guards them by His side,
arrays in garments, white and pure,
His spotless bride:
with streams of sacred bliss,
with gross of living joys -
with all the fruits of paradise
He still supplies.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Before the great Three-One
they all exulting stand;
and tell the wonders He hath done,
through all their land:
the list'ning spheres attend,
and swell the growing fame;
and sing, in songs which never end,
the wondrous Name.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>The whole triumphant host
gives thanks to God on high;
"Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost"
they ever cry.
Hail, Abr'ham's God and mine!
I join the heavenly lays;
all might and majesty are Thine,
and endless praise.</lines>
		</verse>
