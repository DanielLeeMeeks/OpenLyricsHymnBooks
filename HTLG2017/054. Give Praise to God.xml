	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Give praise to God who reigns above
for perfect knowledge, wisdom, love;
His judgments are divine, devout,
His paths beyond all tracing out.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Come, lift our voice to heav'n's high throne,
and glory give to God alone!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>No one can counsel God all-wise
or truths unveil to His sharp eyes;
He marks our paths behind, before;
He is our steadfast Counselor. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Nothing exists that God might need,
for all things good from Him proceed.
We praise Him as our Lord, and yet
we never place God in our debt. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Creation, life, salvation too,
and all things else both good and true,
come from and through our God always,
and fill our hearts with grateful praise. [Refrain]</lines>
		</verse>
