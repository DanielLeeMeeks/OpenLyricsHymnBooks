		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Priest and Victim, Jesus dies,
gives Himself in sacrifice.
Christ, the sinless Son of God,
offers up for us His blood,
gives Himself in sacrifice,
Priest and Victim, Jesus dies!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Mighty Victor, see Him rise,
bringing man to paradise;
sin and death no more may claim
those who trust His saving name;
bringing man to paradise,
mighty Victor, see Him rise!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Lord of life, behold Him stand
now for us at God's right hand.
Still our human frame He wears,
feels our woes and heeds our prayers;
now for us at God's right hand,
Lord of life, behold Him stand!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Prince and Savior, Christ shall come,
soon to take His ransomed home;
His the kingdom, His the pow'r,
His the glory in that hour,
soon to take His ransomed home,
Prince and Savior, Christ shall come!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>King forever, He shall reign,
Lord of death and sin and pain;
pure and righteous, strong and free,
He shall rule in equity;
Lord of death and sin and pain,
King forever, He shall reign!</lines>
		</verse>
