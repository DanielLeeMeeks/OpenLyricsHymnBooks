		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>In shady, green pastures, so rich and so sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water’s cool flow bathes the weary one’s feet,
God leads His dear children along.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Some through the waters, some through the flood,
Some through the fire, but all through the blood;
Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song,
In the night season and all the day long.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Though sorrows befall us and evils oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Away from the mire, and away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity’s day,
God leads His dear children along.</lines>
		</verse>
