	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Do not wait until some deed of greatness you may do,
Do not wait to shed your light afar;
To the many duties ever near you now be true,
Brighten the corner where you are.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Brighten the corner where you are!
Brighten the corner where you are!
Someone far from harbor you may guide across the bar;
Brighten the corner where you are!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Just above are clouded skies that you may help to clear,
Let not narrow self your way debar;
Though into one heart alone may fall your song of cheer,
Brighten the corner where you are.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Here for all your talent you may surely find a need,
Here reflect the bright and Morning Star;
Even from your humble hand the Bread of Life may feed,
Brighten the corner where you are.</lines>
		</verse>
