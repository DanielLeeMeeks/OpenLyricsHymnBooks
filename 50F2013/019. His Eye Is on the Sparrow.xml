		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heav’n and home,
When Jesus is my portion? My constant Friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I sing because I’m happy, I sing because I’m free,
For His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>“Let not your heart be troubled,” His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubts and fears;
Though by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing, when hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him, from care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me.</lines>
		</verse>
