	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>But, Lord, â€™tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.</lines>
		</verse>
