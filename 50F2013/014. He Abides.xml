		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I’m rejoicing night and day
As I walk the narrow way,
For the hand of God in all my life I see;
And the reason of my bliss,
Yes, the secret all is this:
That the Comforter abides with me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He abides, He abides;
Hallelujah, He abides with me!
I’m rejoicing night and day
As I walk the narrow way,
For the Comforter abides with me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Once my heart was full of sin,
Once I had no peace within,
Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree;
Then I fell down at His feet,
And there came a peace so sweet;
Now the Comforter abides with me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He is with me everywhere,
And He knows my every care;
I’m as happy as a bird and just as free;
For the Spirit has control;
Jesus satisfies my soul,
Since the Comforter abides with me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There’s no thirsting for the things
Of the world—they’ve taken wings;
Long ago I gave them up, and instantly
All my night was turned to day,
All my burdens rolled away;
Now the Comforter abides with me.</lines>
		</verse>
