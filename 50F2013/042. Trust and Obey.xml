		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will, He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Not a shadow can rise, not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear, not a sigh or a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Not a burden we bear, not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief or a loss, not a frown or a cross,
But is blessed if we trust and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>But we never can prove the delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows, for the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Then in fellowship sweet we will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do, where He sends we will go;
Never fear, only trust and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
