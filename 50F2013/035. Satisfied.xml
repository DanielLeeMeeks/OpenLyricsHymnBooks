	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>All my life I had a longing
For a drink from some clear spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings,
Through His blood I now am saved.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Poor I was, and sought for riches,
Something that would satisfy,
But the dust I gathered round me
Only mocked my soulâ€™s sad cry.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Well of water, ever springing,
Bread of life so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me.</lines>
		</verse>
