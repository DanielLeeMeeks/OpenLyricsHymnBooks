		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.
Mold me and make me after Thy will,
While I am waiting, yielded and still.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me, Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
Power, all power, surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!
Hold oâ€™er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see
Christ only, always, living in me.</lines>
		</verse>
