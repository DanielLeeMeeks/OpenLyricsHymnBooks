		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I walked one day along a country road,
And there a stranger journeyed, too,
Bent low beneath the burden of His load:
It was a cross, a cross I knew.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>“Take up thy cross and follow Me,”
I hear the blessed Savior call;
How can I make a lesser sacrifice,
When Jesus gave His all?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I cried, “Lord Jesus,” and He spoke my name;
I saw His hands all bruised and torn;
I stooped to kiss away the marks of shame,
The shame for me that He had borne.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>“Oh, let me bear Thy cross, dear Lord,” I cried,
And, lo, a cross for me appeared,
The one, forgotten, I had cast aside,
The one, so long, that I had feared.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>My cross I’ll carry till the crown appears—
The way I journey soon will end—
Where God Himself shall wipe away all tears,
And friend hold fellowship with friend.</lines>
		</verse>
