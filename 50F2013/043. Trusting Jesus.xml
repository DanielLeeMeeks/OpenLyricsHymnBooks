		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Simply trusting every day,
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Trusting as the moments fly,
Trusting as the days go by;
Trusting Him whateâ€™er befall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall;
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Singing if my way is clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger for Him call;
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting Him till earth be past;
Till within the jasper wall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.</lines>
		</verse>
