		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There is beauty all around,
When there’s love at home;
There is joy in every sound,
When there’s love at home;
Peace and plenty here abide,
Smiling sweet on every side,
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there’s love at home.
Refrain 1:
Love at home, love at home;
Time doth softly, sweetly glide,
When there’s love at home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>In the cottage there is joy,
When there’s love at home;
Hate and envy ne’er annoy,
When there’s love at home;
Roses bloom beneath our feet,
All the earth’s a garden sweet,
Making life a bliss complete,
When there’s love at home.
Refrain 2:
Love at home, love at home;
Making life a bliss complete,
When there’s love at home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Love becomes a way of life,
When there’s love at home;
Sweet, insistent end to strife,
When there’s love at home;
Glad submission each one’s gift,
Willing pledge to love and lift,
Healing balm for every rift,
When there’s love at home.
Refrain 3:
Love at home, love at home;
Healing balm for every rift,
When there’s love at home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Anger cools and pressures cease,
When there’s love at home;
Children learn to live in peace,
When there’s love at home;
Courage to reach out in grace,
Meet a stranger face to face,
Find a reconciling place,
When there’s love at home.
Refrain 4:
Love at home, love at home;
Find a reconciling place,
When there’s love at home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>There’s no question you can’t ask,
When there’s love at home;
There is strength for any task,
When there’s love at home;
Sharing joy in work or play,
Confidence to face the day,
Knowing love will find a way,
When there’s love at home.
Refrain 5:
Love at home, love at home;
Knowing love will find a way,
When there’s love at home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Kindly heaven smiles above,
When there’s love at home;
All the world is filled with love,
When there’s love at home;
Sweeter sings the brooklet by,
Brighter beams the azure sky;
Oh, there’s One who smiles on high
When there’s love at home.
Refrain 6:
Love at home, love at home;
Oh, there’s One who smiles on high
When there’s love at home.</lines>
