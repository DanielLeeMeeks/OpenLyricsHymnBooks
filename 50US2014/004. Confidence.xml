		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>We will not falter in the battle,
For by the grace of God we’ll stand,
And while we use our Captain’s armor,
No one can pluck us from His hand;
He is our confidence and courage,
While we obey we’ll never fall;
Let us be true, and fight in Jesus’ might,
Follow our mighty Captain’s call.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Lord, I need grace to be Your soldier—
Grace that will bear the battle’s din;
Strengthen me at my post of duty,
That I may conquer every sin;
You are my confidence and courage,
Not a defeat You’ve ever known;
I will not quit nor yield, but trust Your shield,
Strong in the strength You give Your own.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>We will not fear the foe’s appearance,
For we are led by Christ our King:
He is the Captain of Salvation,
And of His conquests we will sing;
He is our confidence and courage,
He is the One Who set us free;
And with our hearts aglow we’ll rout the foe,
For He has promised victory!</lines>
		</verse>
