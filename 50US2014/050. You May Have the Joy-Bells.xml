		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>You may have the joy-bells ringing in your heart,
And a peace that from you never will depart;
Walk the straight and narrow way,
Live for Jesus every day,
He will keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Joy-bells ringing in your heart,
Joy-bells ringing in your heart;
Take the Savior here below
With you everywhere you go;
He will keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Love of Jesus in its fullness you may know;
And this love to those around you sweetly show;
Words of kindness always say;
Deeds of mercy do each day,
Then He’ll keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>You will meet with trials as you journey home;
Grace sufficient He will give to overcome;
Though unseen by mortal eye,
He is with you ever nigh,
And He’ll keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Let your life speak well of Jesus every day;
Own His right to every service you can pay;
Sinners you can help to win
If your life is pure and clean,
And you keep the joy-bells ringing in your heart.</lines>
		</verse>
