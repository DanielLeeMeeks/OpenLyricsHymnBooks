		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Fear not, little flock, from the cross to the throne,
From death into life He went for His own;
All power in earth, all power above,
Is given to Him for the flock of His love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Only believe, only believe;
All things are possible, only believe;
Only believe, only believe;
All things are possible, only believe.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Fear not, little flock, He goeth ahead,
Your Shepherd selecteth the path you must tread;
The waters of Marah He’ll sweeten for thee,
He drank all the bitter in Gethsemane.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Fear not, little flock, whatever your lot,
He enters all rooms, “the doors being shut,”
He never forsakes; He never is gone,
So count on His presence in darkness and dawn.</lines>
		</verse>
