		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus, priceless Treasure,
Source of purest pleasure,
Truest friend to me.
Long my heart hath panted,
Till it almost fainted,
Thirsting after Thee.
Thine I am, O spotless Lamb,
I will suffer naught to hide Thee,
Ask for nought beside Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>In Thy arms I rest me;
Foes who would molest me
Cannot reach me here.
Though the earth be shaking,
Every heart be quaking,
Jesus calms my fear.
Sin and hell in conflict fell,
With their heaviest storms assail me:
Jesus will not fail me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Satan, I defy thee;
Death, I now decry thee;
Fear, I bid thee cease.
World, thou shalt not harm me
Nor thy threats alarm me
While I sing of peace.
God’s great pow’r guards every hour;
Earth and all its depths adore Him,
Silent bow before Him.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Evil world, I leave thee;
Thou shalt not deceive me,
Thy appeal is vain.
Sin that once did bind me,
Get thee far behind me,
Come not forth again.
Past thy hour, O pride and pow’r;
Sinful life, thy bonds I sever,
Leave thee now forever.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Hence, all earthly treasure!
Jesus is my pleasure;
Jesus is my choice.
Hence, all empty glory!
What to me thy story
Told with tempting voice?
Pain or loss or shame or cross
Shall not from my Savior move me,
Since He chose to love me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v6">
			<lines>Hence, all thought of sadness!
For the Lord of gladness,
Jesus, enters in.
Those who love the Father,
Though the storms may gather,
Still have peace within;
Yea, whate’er we here must bear,
Still in Thee lies purest pleasure,
Jesus, priceless Treasure!</lines>
