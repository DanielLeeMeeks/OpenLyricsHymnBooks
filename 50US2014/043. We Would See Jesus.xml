	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>We would see Jesus, for the shadows lengthen
Across this little landscape of our life;
We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen
For the last weariness, the final strife.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>We would see Jesus, the great rock foundation
Whereon our feet were set with sov’reign grace;
Nor life nor death, with all their agitation,
Can thence remove us, if we see His face.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>We would see Jesus; other lights are paling,
Which for long years we have rejoiced to see;
The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing;
We would not mourn them, for we go to Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>We would see Jesus: this is all we’re needing;
Strength, joy, and willingness come with the sight;
We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading;
Then welcome day, and farewell mortal night.</lines>
		</verse>
