		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I know my heav’nly Father knows
The storms that would my way oppose;
But He can drive the clouds away,
And turn the darkness into day.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He knows, He knows
The storms that would my way oppose;
He knows, He knows,
And tempers every wind that blows.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I know my heav’nly Father knows
The balm I need to soothe my woes;
And with His touch of love divine
He heals this wounded heart of mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I know my heav’nly Father knows
How frail I am to meet my foes;
But He my cause will e’er defend,
Uphold and keep me to the end.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I know my heav’nly Father knows
The hour my journey here will close;
And may that hour, O faithful Guide,
Find me safe sheltered by Thy side.</lines>
		</verse>
