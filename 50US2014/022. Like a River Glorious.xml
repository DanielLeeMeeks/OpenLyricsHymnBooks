	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Like a river glorious is Godâ€™s perfect peace,
Over all victorious, in its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it floweth fuller every day,
Perfect, yet it groweth deeper all the way.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Stayed upon Jehovah, hearts are fully blest
Finding, as He promised, perfect peace and rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Hidden in the hollow of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow, never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry, not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry touch the spirit there.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Every joy or trial falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial by the Sun of Love;
We may trust Him fully all for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly find Him wholly true.</lines>
		</verse>
