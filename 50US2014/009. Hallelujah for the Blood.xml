		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Hallelujah for the blood, for the sin-cleansing fountain,
For the Lamb has been slain, and the ransom price paid;
Fully cancelled was the debt, when on Calvaryâ€™s mountain
All the sins of this world upon Jesus were laid.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>There was no arm to save, there was no eye to pity,
Until Jesus our Savior from glory came down;
He was mighty to save, He was strong to deliver,
He has brought us salvation, a robe and a crown;
Hallelujah, hallelujah, sing the triumphant strain;
Hallelujah, for the blood and the Lamb that was slain.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Hallelujah for the blood; sing for joy, all ye nations,
And rejoice that the work of redemption is done;
Here is pardon free for all, and a perfect salvation
Through the sin-cleansing blood of the Crucified One.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Hallelujah for the blood, hallelujah forever!
We shall sing it anew in the kingdom of God,
Where the anthems of delight shall be silent, no, never;
Evermore hallelujah for Christ and the blood.</lines>
		</verse>
