		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of glory died,
My richest gain I count but loss,
And pour contempt on all my pride.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>See from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did eâ€™er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.</lines>
		</verse>
