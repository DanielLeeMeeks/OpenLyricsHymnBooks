		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I want to go to Heaven, that Home so bright and fair;
So beautiful, and—best of all—Dear Jesus will be there!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I want to see the city away beyond the sky,
With pearly gates and walls of shining stones so great and high;
Beside the crystal river there is a fruitful tree;
And, oh, I want to see the mansions made for you and me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I never will get hurt there, I’ll never have to cry;
No pain or sickness there in Heav’n, and none will ever die;
There Satan cannot tempt me to even once be bad,
For sin can never enter Heav’n—I’ll be so safe, so glad!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I’ll see old Noah, Moses, Elijah, Daniel, Paul,
And all the millions since that time who gave to God their all;
The many little children who’ve died before they’re old
Are singing ’round the throne of God, and play on streets of gold!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Oh, there I’ll be so happy with friends both old and young;
The lame and blind, now healed and well, praise God in endless song;
The angels too will join us; and dressed in spotless white,
We’ll not get tired of praising God, for there there is no night!</lines>
		</verse>
