		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Since the love of God has shed
Priceless blessings on my head,
I have made it my own;
I will hide it in my heart
That it never may depart,
It shall rule there alone.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>The love of God within the heart
Will kindliness and warmth impart;
The soul will glow like Jesus in His tender mercy,
If the heart is made His dwelling place;
The love of God glows like a flame,
Through endless years it is the same;
The love of God will never fail nor lose its glory
Till we see Him face to face.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Since the Son of God came down
With His love our lives to crown,
He with us would remain;
Greater love there could not be,
Jesus died for you and me,
In our hearts, He would reign.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He who gave His love to me
That I might from sin be free
Bids me share it today;
“As I love you,” He has said,
“You must serve men in My stead
As you go on your way.”</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>While His love burns true and bright,
We are walking in the light,
He has shown us the road;
We His glory must reflect,
Lest our dimness and neglect
Keep some soul from it’s God.</lines>
		</verse>
