		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Tender love of Jesus, so lovely and so pure;
Flowing through this vessel to strengthen, fill, and cure
All the doubt and turmoil that’s caused by sin and shame,
Making me a witness to His most holy name.
Refrain 1-2:
Yes, love, Christ’s love, pure love, great love;
With joy my heart is singing, the things of life grow dim,
For Christ is love!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Through the passing ages flowed down this love divine,
Lighting men and angels and causing them to shine
With a heav’nly radiance, His glory from above,
Sunshine of the Spirit, the holy light of love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Tender love from heaven in Jesus came to live,
Showing us how God loves, and then His life to give;
Came to be a servant, with God’s great pow’r and peace
Leads us to the Father, Whose love will never cease.
Refrain 3-4:
God’s love, sweet love from Heav’n above;
This love is like an ocean, its waves are reaching me;
Christ came this love to be.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Love is mine in Jesus, this babe of Bethlehem,
Prince of Peace forever, the Christ, the great I AM;
Angels gave the message, and shepherds passed it on,
Love will be the story when heav’n and earth are gone.</lines>
		</verse>
