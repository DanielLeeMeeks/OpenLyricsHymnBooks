		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Happy the home when God is there,
And love fills every breast;
When one their wish, and one their prayer,
And one their heav’nly rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Happy the home where Jesus’ name
Is sweet to every ear;
Where children early speak His fame,
And parents hold Him dear.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Happy the home where prayer is heard,
And praise is wont to rise;
Where parents love the sacred Word
And all its wisdom prize.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Lord, let us in our homes agree
This blessed peace to gain;
Unite our hearts in love to Thee,
And love to all will reign.</lines>
		</verse>
