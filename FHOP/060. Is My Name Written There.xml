		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Lord, I care not for riches,
Neither silver nor gold;
I would make sure of heaven,
I would enter the fold.
In the book of Thy kingdom
With its pages so fair,
Tell me, Jesus, my Savior,
Is my name written there?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Is my name written there,
On the page white and fair?
In the book of Thy kingdom,
Is my name written there?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Lord, my sins they are many,
Like the sands of the sea,
But Thy blood, O my Savior,
Is sufficient for me;
For Thy promise is written,
In bright letters that glow,
“Tho' your sins be as scarlet,
I will make them like snow.” </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O that beautiful city
With its mansions of light,
With its glorified beings
In pure garments of white;
Where no evil thing cometh
To despoil what is fair,
Where the angels are watching,
Yes, my name’s written there.
Yes, my name's written there,
On the page white and fair?
In the book of Thy kingdom,
Yes, my name's written there?</lines>
		</verse>
