		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Now let songs of triumph swell loud and clear, loud and clear,
Christ has conquered sin and hell, sing it loud and clear.
Once for us in mortal fray,
Climbed He Calv'ry's rugged way.
Praise Him now in gladsome lay;
Sing it loud and clear!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Gone, yes, gone forevermore!
Fully settled is the score!
Since He purged my guilty stains,
Not a spot remains;
Gone, yes, gone! Gone, yes, gone!
Gone, yes, gone forevermore!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Sins as black as death's dark shroud blotted out, blotted out!
As the thickest thundercloud, all are blotted out.
From God's memory erased--
At such mercy stand amazed
Be His name forever praised;
All are blotted out! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Far as east is from the west they are gone, they are gone.
O, how richly we are blest, for our sins are gone.
In the deep, unfathomed sea
They are cast, and we are free.
Join our glorious jubilee--
All our sins are gone! </lines>
		</verse>
