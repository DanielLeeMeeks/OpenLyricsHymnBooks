		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Trying to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Trying to follow our Savior and King;
Shaping our lives by His blessed example,
Happy, how happy, the songs that we bring.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Stepping in the light, stepping in the light;
How beautiful to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Led in paths of light.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Pressing more closely to Him who is leading,
When we are tempted to turn from the way;
Trusting the arm that is strong to defend us,
Happy, how happy, our praises each day. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Walking in footsteps of gentle forbearance,
Footsteps of faithfulness, mercy and love,
Looking to Him for the grace freely promised,
Happy, how happy, our journey above. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Trying to walk in the steps of the Savior,
Upward, still upward, we'll follow our Guide;
When we shall see Him, “the King in His beauty,”
Happy, how happy, our place at His side. </lines>
		</verse>
