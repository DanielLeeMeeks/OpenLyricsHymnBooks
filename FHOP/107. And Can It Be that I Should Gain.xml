		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Saviour's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race;
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth and followed Thee. </lines>
