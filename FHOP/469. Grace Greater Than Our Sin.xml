		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Marvelous grace of our loving Lord,
Grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt,
Yonder on Calvary's mount out-poured,
There where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater than all our sin.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Sin and despair like the sea waves cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
Points to the Refuge, the Mighty Cross. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
What can avail to wash it away?
Look! there is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe;
All who are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace receive? </lines>
		</verse>
