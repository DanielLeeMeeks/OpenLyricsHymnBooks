		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>’Tis the blessèd hour of prayer, when our hearts lowly bend,
And we gather to Jesus, our Savior and Friend;
If we come to Him in faith, His protection to share,
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Blessèd hour of prayer,
Blessèd hour of prayer;
What a balm for the weary!
O how sweet to be there!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>’Tis the blessèd hour of prayer, when the Savior draws near,
With a tender compassion His children to hear;
When He tells us we may cast at His feet every care,
What a balm for the weary, O how sweet to be there! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>’Tis the blessèd hour of prayer, when the tempted and tried
To the Savior who loves them their sorrow confide;
With a sympathizing heart He removes every care;
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>At the blessèd hour of prayer, trusting Him we believe
That the blessings we’re needing we’ll surely receive;
In the fullness of this trust we shall lose every care;
What a balm for the weary! O how sweet to be there! </lines>
		</verse>
