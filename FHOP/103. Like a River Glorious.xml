		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Like a river glorious
Is God’s perfect peace,
Over all victorious,
In its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it floweth
Fuller every day,
Perfect, yet it groweth
Deeper all the way.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Stayed upon Jehovah,
Hearts are fully blest;
Finding, as He promised,
Perfect peace and rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow,
Never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry,
Not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry
Touch the spirit there. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Every joy or trial
Falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial
By the Sun of Love.
We may trust Him fully
All for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly
Find Him wholly true. </lines>
		</verse>
