		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go;
Anywhere He leads me in this world below;
Anywhere without Him dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Anywhere! anywhere! Fear I cannot know;
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone;
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own;
Tho' His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Anywhere with Jesus over land and sea,
Telling souls in darkness of salvation free;
Ready as He summons me to go or stay,
Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the dark'ning shadows round about me creep;
Knowing I shall waken never more to roam,
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home. </lines>
		</verse>
