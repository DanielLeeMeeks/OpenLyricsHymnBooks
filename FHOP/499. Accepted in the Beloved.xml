	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>"In the Beloved" accepted am I,
Risen, ascended, and seated on high;
Saved from all sin thro' His infinite grace,
With the redeemed ones accorded a place</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>"In the Beloved," God's marvelous grace
Calls me to dwell in this wonderful place;
God sees my Savior and then He sees me
"In the Beloved," accepted and free.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>"In the Beloved"--how safe my retreat,
In the Beloved accounted complete;
"Who can condemn me?" In Him I am free,
Savior and Keeper forever is He. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"In the Beloved" I went to the tree,
There, in His Person, by faith I may see
Infinite wrath rolling over His head,
Infinite grace, for He died in my stead. </lines>
		</verse>
