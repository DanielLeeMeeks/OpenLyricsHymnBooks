		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There comes to my heart one sweet strain,
A glad and a joyous refrain;
I sing it again and again,
Sweet peace, the gift of God’s love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Peace, peace, sweet peace!
Wonderful gift from above!
O wonderful, wonderful peace!
Sweet peace, the gift of God’s love!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Thro' Christ on the cross peace was made,
My debt by His death was all paid;
No other foundation is laid
For peace, the gift of God’s love. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>When Jesus as Lord I had crowned,
My heart with this peace did abound;
In Him the rich blessing I found--
Sweet peace, the gift of God’s love. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>In Jesus for peace I abide,
And as I keep close to His side,
There’s nothing but peace doth betide,
Sweet peace, the gift of God’s love. </lines>
		</verse>
