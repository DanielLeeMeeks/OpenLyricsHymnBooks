		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Naught have I gotten but what I received;
Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;
Boasting excluded, pride I abase;
I’m only a sinner, saved by grace!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Only a sinner saved by grace!
Only a sinner saved by grace!
This is my story, to God be the glory,—-
I’m only a sinner saved by grace!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,
Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
Jesus hath found me, happy my case;
I now am a sinner, saved by grace! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Tears unavailing, no merit had I;
Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;
Sin had alarmed me, fearing God’s face;
But now I’m a sinner saved by grace! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,
Loving his Savior to tell what he knows;
Once more to tell it would I embrace--
I’m only a sinner saved by grace! </lines>
		</verse>
