		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Face to face with Christ, my Saviour,
Face to face--what will it be?
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ who died for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Face to face I shall behold Him,
Far beyond the starry sky;
Face to face in all His glory,
I shall see Him by and by!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Only faintly now I see Him,
With the darkened veil between,
But a blessed day is coming
When His glory shall be seen. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>What rejoicing in His presence
When are banished grief and pain;
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Face to face! O blissful moment!
Face to face--to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ who loves me so. </lines>
		</verse>
