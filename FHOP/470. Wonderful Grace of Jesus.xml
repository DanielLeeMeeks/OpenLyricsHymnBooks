		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Greater than all my sin;
How shall my tongue describe it,
Where shall its praise begin?
Taking away my burden,
Setting my spirit free;
For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus,
Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;
Higher than the mountain, sparkling like a fountain,
All-sufficient grace for even me,
Broader than the scope of my transgressions,
Greater far than all my sin and shame,
O magnify the precious name of Jesus,
Praise his name!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Reaching to all the lost,
By it I have been pardoned,
Saved to the uttermost,
Chains have been torn asunder,
Giving me liberty,;
For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Reaching the most defiled,
By its transforming power
Making him God's dear child,
Purchasing peace and heaven,
For all eternity;
And the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me. </lines>
		</verse>
