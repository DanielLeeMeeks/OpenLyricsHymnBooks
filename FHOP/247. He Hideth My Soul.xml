		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me,
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
And covers me there with His hand,
And covers me there with His hand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved,
He giveth me strength as my day. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
And, filled with His fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God
For such a Redeemer as mine! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>When clothed with His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
Iâ€™ll shout with the millions on high. </lines>
		</verse>
