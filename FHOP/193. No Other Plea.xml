		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>My faith has found a resting place,
Not in device nor creed;
I trust the Everliving One,
His wounds for me shall plead.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I need no other argument,
I need no other plea,
It is enough that Jesus died,
And that He died for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him,
He’ll never cast me out. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>My heart is leaning on the Word,
The written Word of God,
Salvation by my Saviour’s name,
Salvation thro' His blood. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave. </lines>
		</verse>
