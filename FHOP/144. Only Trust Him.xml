		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come, every soul by sin oppressed,
There's mercy with the Lord;
And He will surely give you rest
By trusting in His word.
Only trust Him, only trust Him,
Only trust Him now.
He will save you, He will save you,
He will save you now.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>For Jesus shed His precious blood,
Rich blessings to bestow;
Plunge now into the crimson flood
That washes white as snow.
Only trust Him, only trust Him,
Only trust Him now.
He will save you, He will save you,
He will save you now.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,
That leads you into rest:
Believe in Him without delay,
And you are fully blest.
Only trust Him, only trust Him,
Only trust Him now.
He will save you, He will save you,
He will save you now.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Come, then, and join this holy band,
And on to glory go,
To dwell in that celestial land,
Where joys immortal flow.
Only trust Him, only trust Him,
Only trust Him now.
He will save you, He will save you,
He will save you now.</lines>
