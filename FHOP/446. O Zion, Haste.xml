		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O Zion, haste, your mission high fulfilling,
To tell to all the world that God is Light;
That He Who made all nations is not willing
One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
Tidings of Jesus, redemption, and release.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Behold how many thousands still are lying,
Bound in the darksome prison-house of sin,
With none to tell them of the Saviour's dying,
Or of the life He died for them to win. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Proclaim to ev'ry people, tongue and nation
That God in Whom they live and move is love:
Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation,
And died on earth that man might live above. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Give of your sons to bear the message glorious;
Give of your wealth to speed them on their way;
Pour out your soul for them in prayer victorious;
And all thou spendest Jesus will repay. </lines>
		</verse>
