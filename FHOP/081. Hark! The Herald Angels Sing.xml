		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new-born King:
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;
God and sinners reconciled."
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With angelic host proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!"</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Christ, by highest Heav'n adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord:
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
Hail th'incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with men to appear,
Jesus our Immanuel here.
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King!"</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Hail the Heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris'n with healing in His wings:
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth;
Born to give them second birth.
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King."</lines>
