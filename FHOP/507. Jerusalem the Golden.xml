		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jerusalem the golden,
With milk and honey blest!.
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice opprest.
I know not, O I know not,
What joys await us there;
What radiancy of glory!
What bliss beyond compare!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>They stand, those halls of Zion,
All jubilant with song,
And bright with many an angel,
And all the martyr throng.
The Prince is ever in them,
The daylight is serene;
The pastures of the blessed
Are decked in glorious sheen.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>There is the throne of David;
And there, from care released,
The song of them that triumph,
The shout of them that feast;
And they, who with their Leader
Have conquered in the fight,
Forever and forever
Are clad in robes of white.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God's elect!
O sweet and blessed country
That eager hearts expect!
Jesus, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest;
Who art, with God the Father
And Spirit, ever blest.
Amen.</lines>
