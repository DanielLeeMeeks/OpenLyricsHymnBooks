		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus is standing in Pilate’s hall--
Friendless, forsaken, betrayed by all:
Hearken! what meaneth the sudden call!
What will you do with Jesus?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>What will you do with Jesus?
Neutral you cannot be;
Someday your heart will be asking,
“What will He do with me?”</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus is standing on trial still,
You can be false to Him if you will,
You can be faithful thro' good or ill:
What will you do with Jesus? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Will you evade Him as Pilate tried?
Or will you choose Him, whate’er betide?
Vainly you struggle from Him to hide:
What will you do with Jesus? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Will you, like Peter, your Lord deny?
Or will you scorn from His foes to fly,
Daring for Jesus to live or die?
What will you do with Jesus? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>“Jesus, I give Thee my heart today!
Jesus, I’ll follow Thee all the way,
Gladly obeying Thee!” will you say:
“This I will do with Jesus!” </lines>
		</verse>
