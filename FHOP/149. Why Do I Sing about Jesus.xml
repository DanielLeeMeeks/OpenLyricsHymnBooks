		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Deep in my heart there's a gladness,
Jesus has saved me from sin!
Praise to His name, what a Saviour!
Cleansing without and within.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Why do I sing about Jesus?
Why is He precious to me?
He is my Lord and my Saviour,
Dying! He set me free!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Only a glimpse of His goodness,
That was sufficient for me;
Only one look at the Saviour,
Then was my spirit set free. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He is the fairest of fair ones,
He is the Lily, the Rose;
Rivers of mercy surround Him,
Grace, love, and pity He shows. </lines>
		</verse>
