		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
Thro' eternal ages let His praises ring;
Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on the promises of God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Standing on the promises I cannot fall,
List'ning ev'ry moment to the Spirit's call,
Resting in my Savior, as my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God. </lines>
		</verse>
