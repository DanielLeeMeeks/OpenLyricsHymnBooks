		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>For Christ is born of Mary;
And gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wond'ring love,
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth!
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is giv'n!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His Heav'n.
No ear may hear His coming;
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him still,
The dear Christ enters in.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell,--
O come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel.</lines>
		</verse>
