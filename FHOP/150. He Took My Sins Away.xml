		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I came to Jesus, weary, worn, and sad,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away,
And now His love has made my heart so glad,
He took my sins away.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He took my sins away,
He took my sins away,
And keeps me singing ev'ry day!
I’m so glad He took my sins away.
He took my sins away.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The load of sin was more than I could bear.
He took them all away,
He took them all away,
And now on Him I roll my ev'ry care,
He took my sins away. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>No condemnation have I in my heart,
He took my sins away,
He took my sins away,
His perfect peace He did to me impart,
He took my sins away. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>If you will come to Jesus Christ today,
He’ll take your sins away,
He’ll take your sins away,
And keep you happy in His love each day.
He’ll take your sins away. </lines>
		</verse>
