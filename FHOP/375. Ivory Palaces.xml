	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>My Lord has garments so wondrous fine,
And myrrh their texture fills;
Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine,
With joy my being thrills.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Out of the ivory palaces
Into a world of woe,
Only His great eternal love
Made my Savior go.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>His life had also its sorrows sore,
For aloes had a part;
And when I think of the cross He bore,
My eyes with teardrops start. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>His garments too were in cassia dipped,
With healing in a touch;
Each time my feet in some sin have slipped,
He took me from its clutch. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>In garments glorious He will come,
To open wide the door;
And I shall enter my heavâ€™nly home,
To dwell forevermore. </lines>
		</verse>
