		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Free from the law, O happy condition,
Jesus hath bled, and there is remission;
Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall,
Grace hath redeemed us once for all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Once for all, O sinner, receive it;
Once for all, O brother, believe it;
Cling to the Cross, the burden will fall,
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Now we are free--there's no condemnation,
Jesus provides a perfect salvation;
"Come unto Me," O hear His sweet call,
Come, and He saves us once for all. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"Children of God", O glorious calling,
Surely His grace will keep us from falling;
Passing from death to life at His call,
Blessed salvation once for all. </lines>
		</verse>
