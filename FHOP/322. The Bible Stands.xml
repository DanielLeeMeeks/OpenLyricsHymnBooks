		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The Bible stands like a rock undaunted
'Mid the raging storms of time;
Its pages burn with the truth eternal,
And they glow with a light sublime.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>The Bible stands tho' the hills may tumble,
It will firmly stand when the earth shall crumble;
I will plant my feet on its firm foundation,
For the Bible stands.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The Bible stands like a mountain tow'ring
Far above the works of man;
Its truth by none ever was refuted,
And destroy it they never can. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The Bible stands and it will forever,
When the world has passed away;
By inspiration it has been given,
All its precepts I will obey. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The Bible stands ev'ry test we give it,
For its Author is divine;
By grace alone I will expect to live it,
And to prove it and make it mine. </lines>
		</verse>
