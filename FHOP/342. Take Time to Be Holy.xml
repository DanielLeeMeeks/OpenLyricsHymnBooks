		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Take time to be holy,
Speak oft with thy Lord;
Abide in Him always,
And feed on His Word.
Make friends of God's children;
Help those who are weak;
Forgetting in nothing
His blessing to seek.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Take time to be holy,
The world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret
With Jesus alone;
By looking to Jesus,
Like Him thou shalt be;
Thy friends in thy conduct
His likeness shall see.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Take time to be holy,
Let Him be thy guide,
And run not before Him,
Whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow,
Still follow thy Lord,
And, looking to Jesus,
Still trust in His Word.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Take time to be holy,
Be calm in thy soul;
Each tho't and each motive
Beneath His control;
Thus led by His Spirit
To fountains of love,
Thou soon shalt be fitted
For service above.</lines>
		</verse>
