		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I heard the bells on Christmas day
Their old familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet the words repeat
Of peace of earth, goodwill to men.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I thought how, as the day had come,
The belfries of all Christendom
Had rolled along th'unbroken song
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>And in despair I bowed my head:
"There is no peace on earth," I said,
"For hate is strong, and mocks the song
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
"God is not dead: nor doth He sleep;
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
With peace on earth, goodwill to men."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Till, ringing, singing on its way,
The world revolved from night to day,
A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,
Of peace on earth, goodwill to men!</lines>
		</verse>
