		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I've heard the King! The King of heaven!
Nor can I e'er forget the music of His voice.
I've heard the King! His call I've answered.
I've made the King of heav'n my everlasting choice.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He came to me, and with Him came a blessing.
He spoke to me, and glory filled my soul;
His voice I heard, so charming and so wondrous.
I've heard the King, and hearing am made whole.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I've heard the King! The King of glory;
For whom my heart's door opened wide and He came in.
I've heard the King! Oh, blessed hearing,
His voice spoke peace and pardon for my guilt and sin. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I've heard the King! Oh, had I missed Him,
My life forevermore could not regain the loss.
From heav'n He came, the world to ransom,
And this He did one day on Calv'ry's cruel cross. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I've heard the King! and now I'm telling
To all the world the gospel of undying love,
That others too may catch the music
His voice can bring, and find their way to heav'n above. </lines>
		</verse>
