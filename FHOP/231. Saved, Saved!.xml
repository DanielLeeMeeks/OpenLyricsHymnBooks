		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I've found a friend who is all to me,
His love is ever true;
I love to tell how He lifted me,
And what His grace can do for you.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Saved by His pow'r divine,
Saved to new life sublime!
Life now is sweet and my joy is complete,
For I'm Saved, saved, saved!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He saves me from ev'ry sin and harm,
Secures my soul each day;
I'm leaning strong on His mighty arm;
I know He'll guide me all the way. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>When poor and needy and all alone,
In love He said to me,
"Come unto Me and I'll lead you home,
To live with me eternally." </lines>
		</verse>
