		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
Upon the Savior's brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o'erflow,
His lips with grace o'erflow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>No mortal can with Him compare,
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair
That fill the heav'nly train,
That fill the heav'nly train.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He saw me plunged in deep distress,
He flew to my relief;
For me He bore the shameful cross
And carried all my grief,
And carried all my grief.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>To Him I owe my life and breath,
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
And saves me from the grave,
And saves me from the grave.</lines>
		</verse>
