		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Friends all around us are trying to find
What the heart yearns for, by sin undermined;
I have the secret, I know where 'tis found:
Only in Jesus true pleasures abound.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>All that I want is in Jesus;
He satisfies, joy He supplies;
Life would be worthless without Him,
All things in Jesus I find.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Some carry burdens whose weight has for years
Crushed them with sorrow and blinded with tears,
Yet One stands ready to help them just now,
If they with faith and in penitence bow. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>No other name thrills the joy chords within,
And thro' none else is remission of sin;
He knows the pain of the heart sorely tried,
All of its needs will in Him be supplied. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Jesus is all this poor world needs today,
Blindly they strive, for sin darkens their way;
O to draw back the grim curtains of night,
One glimpse of Jesus, and all will be bright! </lines>
		</verse>
