		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I belong to the King, I’m a child of His love,
I shall dwell in His palace so fair;
For He tells of its bliss in yon heaven above,
And His children in splendor shall share.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I belong to the King, I’m a child of His love,
And he never forsaketh His own;
He will call me some day to His palace above,
I shall dwell by His glorified throne.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I belong to the King, and He loves me I know,
For His mercy and kindness, so free,
Are unceasingly mine wheresoever I go,
And my refuge unfailing is He. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I belong to the King, and His promise is sure,
That we all shall be gathered at last
In His kingdom above, by life’s waters so pure,
When this life with its trials is past. </lines>
		</verse>
