		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When all my labors and trials are o’er,
And I am safe on that beautiful shore,
Just to be near the dear Lord I adore,
Will thro' the ages be glory for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>O that will be glory for me,
Glory for me, glory for me;
When by His grace I shall look on His face,
That will be glory, be glory for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>When by the gift of His infinite grace,
I am accorded in Heaven a place,
Just to be there and to look on His face,
Will thro' the ages be glory for me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Friends will be there I have loved long ago;
Joy like a river around me will flow;
Yet, just a smile from my Savior, I know,
Will thro' the ages be glory for me. </lines>
		</verse>
