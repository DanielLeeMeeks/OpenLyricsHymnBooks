		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The children's Friend is Jesus,
He calls them to His side;
He gave His life a ransom,
Heav'n's gate to open wide.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>The children's Friend is Jesus,
Jesus, Jesus;
His life He gave their souls to save,
The children's Friend is Jesus.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The children's Friend is Jesus,
He loves their joys to share,
He knows their little sorrows,
He longs each one to bear. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The children's Friend is Jesus,
There's no one else so true;
He keeps all those who trust Him,
As no one else can do. </lines>
