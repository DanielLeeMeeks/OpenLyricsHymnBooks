		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The Saviour is calling, is calling for you,
In accents so tender, so loving and true,
How can you refuse Him? O heed His sweet call!
O, don't turn the Saviour away.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Don't turn the Saviour away from your heart,
Don't turn the Saviour away from your heart;
O hear Him pleading, O list' to His call,
O, don't turn the Saviour away.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The Saviour is calling, why turn Him away?
Sin's burden is heavy, why longer delay!
O heart full of sorrow, there's comfort today;
O, don't turn the Saviour away. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The Saviour is calling, O, can it be true
That life everlasting is waiting for you?
Come now and receive Him, to Satan say nay;
O, don't turn the Saviour away. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The Saviour is calling from Calvary's cross,
Where He died to save you at infinite cost;
His heart there was broken for you and for me;
O, don't turn the Saviour away. </lines>
		</verse>
