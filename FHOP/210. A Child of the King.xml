		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I’m a child of the King,
A child of the King:
With Jesus my Savior
I’m a child of the King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>My Father’s own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them;
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,
That we may be His when He comes by and by. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I once was an outcast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, an alien by birth;
But I’ve been adopted, my name’s written down,
An heir to a mansion, a robe, and a crown. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>A tent or a cottage, why should I care?
They’re building a palace for me over there;
Tho' exiled from home, yet still may I sing:
All glory to God, I’m a child of the King. </lines>
		</verse>
