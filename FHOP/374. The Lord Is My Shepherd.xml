		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The Lord is my Shepherd, no want shall I know;
I feed in green pastures, safe-folded I rest;
He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,
Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppressed;
Restores me when wand'ring, redeems when oppressed.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Thro' the valley and shadow of death tho' I stray,
Since Thou art my guardian, no evil I fear;
Thy rod shall defend me, Thy staff be my stay;
No harm can befall with my Comforter near;
No harm can befall with my Comforter near.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>In the midst of affliction my table is spread;
With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o'er;
With perfume and oil, Thou anointest my head;
O what shall I ask of Thy Providence more?
O what shall I ask of Thy Providence more?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Let goodness and mercy, my bountiful God,
Still follow my steps, till I meet Thee above:
I seek by the path which my forefathers trod,
Thro' the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love;
Thro' the land of their sojourn, Thy kingdom of love.</lines>
		</verse>
