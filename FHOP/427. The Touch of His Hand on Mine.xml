		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There are days so dark that I seek in vain
For the face of my Friend Divine;
But tho' darkness hide, He is there to guide
By the touch of His hand on mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Oh, the touch of His hand on mine,
Oh, the touch of His hand on mine!
There is grace and powâ€™r, in the trying hour,
In the touch of His hand on mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>There are times, when tired of the toilsome road,
That for ways of the world I pine;
But He draws me back to the upward track
By the touch of His hand on mine. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>When the way is dim, and I cannot see
Thro' the mist of His wise design,
How my glad heart yearns and my faith returns
By the touch of His hand on mine. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>In the last sad hour, as I stand alone
Where the powers of death combine,
While the dark waves roll He will guide my soul
By the touch of His hand on mine. </lines>
		</verse>
