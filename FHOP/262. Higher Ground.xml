		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I'm pressing on the upward way,
New height I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I onward bound,
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on Heaven's table-land,
A higher plane than I have found;
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Tho' some may dwell where these abound,
My prayer, my aim is higher ground. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I want to live above the world,
Tho' Satan's darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till Heav'n I've found,
"Lord, lead me on to higher ground." </lines>
		</verse>
