Come into my heart, I pray;

Come into my heart today.</lines>

Come in to stay,
Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.</lines>

The burden of sin is so heavy,
Come into my heart to stay. </lines>

And take all my guilt away;
Then spotless I'll stand in Thy presence,
When breaks Thine eternal day. </lines>

O cleanse and illumine my soul;
Fill me with Thy wonderful Spirit,
Come in and take full control. </lines>
