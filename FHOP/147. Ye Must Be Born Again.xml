		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>A ruler once came to Jesus by night
To ask Him the way of salvation and light;
The Master made answer in words true and plain,
"Ye must be born again."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>"Ye must be born again,
Ye must be born again;
I verily, verily say unto thee,
Ye must be born again."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Ye children of men, attend to the word
So solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord;
And let not this message to you be in vain,
"Ye must be born again." </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O, ye who would enter that glorious rest,
And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest;
The life everlasting if ye would obtain,
"Ye must be born again." </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>A dear one in heaven thy heart yearns to see,
At the beautiful gate may be watching for thee;
Then list to th note of this solemn refrain,
"Yes must be born again." </lines>
		</verse>
