		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O Word of God Incarnate,
O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
O light of our dark sky;
We praise Thee for the radiance
That from the hallowed page,
A lantern to our footsteps
Shines on from age to age.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The church from her dear Master
Received the gift divine,
And still that light she lifteth
O'er all the earth to shine.
It is the golden casket,
Where gems of truth are stored;
It is the heav'n-drawn picture
Of Christ, the living Word.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>It floateth like a banner
Before God's host unfurled;
It shineth like a beacon
Above the darkling world.
It is the chart and compass
That o'er life's surging sea,
'Mid mists and rocks and quicksands,
Still guides, O Christ, to Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O make Thy church, dear Savior,
A lamp of purest gold,
To bear before the nations
Thy true light as of old.
O teach Thy wand'ring pilgrims
By this their path to trace,
Till, clouds and darkness ended,
They see Thee face to face.
Amen.</lines>
		</verse>
