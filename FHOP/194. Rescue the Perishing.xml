		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o’er the erring one,
Lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Though they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently,
He will forgive if they only believe. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that are broken will vibrate once more. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand’rer a Savior has died. </lines>
		</verse>
