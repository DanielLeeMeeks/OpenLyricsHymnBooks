		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I am resolved no longer to linger,
Charmed by the world's delight;
Things that are higher, things that are nobler,
These have allured my sight.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I will hasten to Him,
Hasten so glad and free,
Jesus, Greatest, Highest,
I will come to Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I am resolved to go to the Savior,
Leaving my sin and strife;
He is the true One, He is the just One,
He hath the words of life. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I am resolved to follow the Savior,
Faithful and true each day;
Heed what He sayeth, do what He willeth,
He is the living way. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I am resolved to enter the Kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin;
Friends may oppose me, foes may beset me,
Still will I enter in. </lines>
		</verse>
