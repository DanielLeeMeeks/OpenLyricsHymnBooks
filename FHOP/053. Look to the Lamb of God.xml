		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>If you from sin are longing to be free,
Look to the Lamb of God;
He, to redeem you, died on Calvary,
Look to the Lamb of God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Look to the Lamb of God,
Look to the Lamb of God,
For He alone is able to save you,
Look to the Lamb of God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>When Satan tempts, and doubts and fears assail,
Look to the Lamb of God;
You in His strength shall over all prevail,
Look to the Lamb of God. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Are you aweary, does the way seem long?
Look to the Lamb of God;
His love will cheer and fill your heart with song,
Look to the Lamb of God. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Fear not when shadows on your pathway fall,
Look to the Lamb of God;
In joy or sorrow Christ is all in all,
Look to the Lamb of God. </lines>
