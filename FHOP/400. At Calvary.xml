		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucifed,
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found liberty,
At Calvary.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>By God's Word at last my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary. </lines>
		</verse>
