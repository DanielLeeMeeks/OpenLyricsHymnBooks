		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Out of the depths to the glory above,
I have been lifted in wonderful love;
From ev'ry fetter my spirit is free--
For Jesus has lifted me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Jesus has lifted me!
Jesus has lifted me!
Out of the night into glorious light,
Yes, Jesus has lifted me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Out of the world into heavenly rest,
Into the land of the ransomed and blest;
There in the glory with Him I shall be--
For Jesus has lifted me! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Out of myself into Him I adore,
There to abide in His loved evermore;
Thro' endless ages His glory to see--
My Jesus has lifted me! </lines>
