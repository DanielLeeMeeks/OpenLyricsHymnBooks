		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I love to tell the story
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love.
I love to tell the story
Because I know ’tis true;
It satisfies my longings
As nothing else can do.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I love to tell the story,
’Twill be my theme in glory,
To tell the old, old story
Of Jesus and His love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I love to tell the story,
More wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies
Of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story,
It did so much for me;
And that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I love to tell the story,
’Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems, each time I tell it,
More wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story,
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God’s own holy Word. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I love to tell the story,
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the new, new song,
’Twill be the old, old story
That I have loved so long. </lines>
		</verse>
