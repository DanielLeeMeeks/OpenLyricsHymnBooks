		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Tell me the stories of Jesus
I love to hear;
Things I would ask Him to tell me
If He were here;
Scenes by the wayside,
Tales of the sea,
Stories of Jesus,
Tell them to me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>First let me hear how the children
Stood round His knee;
and I shall fancy His blessing
Resting on me:
Words full of kindness,
Deeds full of grace,
All in the love-light
Of Jesus' face.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Into the city I'd follow,
The children's band,
Waving a branch of the palm tree
High in my hand;
One of His heralds,
Yes, I would sing
Loudest hosannas!
Jesus is King.
Amen.</lines>
