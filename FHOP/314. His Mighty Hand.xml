		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I am saved from sin, I have peace within,
And I walk with Jesus day by day;
O His hand so strong, holds me all day long,
And with Him I will not go astray.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He will hold me with His mighty hand!
He will hold me with His mighty hand!
In temptation He will help me stand!
For He will hold me with His mighty hand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Many passed me by, heeding not my cry,
But the Savior heard and rescued me;
I was lost and blind, Jesus was so kind,
Lo, He touched my eyes and now I see. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>There’s a promise sure and it shall endure,
“Lo, I will be with thee all the way;"
And tho' foes assail, I shall still prevail,
For I know He helps me watch and pray. (Refrai)</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There is sweeter peace, there is perfect peace,
And my Father’s word is wondrous dear;
There is mighty pow’r for each trying hour,
There is love that “casteth out all fear!” </lines>
		</verse>
