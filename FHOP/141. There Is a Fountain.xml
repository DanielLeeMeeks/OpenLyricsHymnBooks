		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains:
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away:
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its pow'r,
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more:
Be saved, to sin no more,
Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved to sin no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>E'er since, by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy pow'r to save,
When this poor lisping, stamm'ring tongue
Lies silent in the grave:
Lies silent in the grave,
Lies silent in the grave;
When this poor lisping, stamm'ring tonue
Lies silent in the grave.</lines>
