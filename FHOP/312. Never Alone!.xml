		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I’ve seen the lightning flashing,
And heard the thunder roll,
I’ve felt sin’s breakers dashing,
Trying to conquer my soul;
I’ve heard the voice of my Savior
Biding me still to fight on;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>No, never alone,
No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
He'll claim me for His own.
No, never alone,
No, never alone,
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The world’s fierce winds are blowing;
Temptation’s sharp and keen;
I have a peace in knowing
My Savior stands between—-
He stands to shield me from danger
When earthly friends are gone;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>When in affliction’s valley
I tread the road of care,
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross so heavy to bear;
Tho' all around me is darkness,
Earthly joys all flown;
My Savior whispers His promise,
Never to leave me alone! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>He died on Calv'ry's mountain,
For me they pierced His side,
For me He opened that fountain,
The crimson, cleansing tide;
For me He’s waiteth in glory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone! </lines>
