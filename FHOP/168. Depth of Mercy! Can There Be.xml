		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Depth of mercy! can there be
Mercy still reserved for me?
Can my God His wrath forbear--
Me, the chief of sinners spare?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I have long with stood His grace,
Long provoked Him to His face,
Would not hearken to His calls,
Grieved Him by a thousand falls.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Now incline me to repent;
Let me now my fall lament;
Now my foul revolt deplore,
Weep, believe, and sin no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There for me my Saviour stands,
Holding forth His wounded hands;
God is love! I know, I feel,
Jesus weeps and loves me still.
Amen.</lines>
		</verse>
