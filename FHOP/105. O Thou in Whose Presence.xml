		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O Thou in whose presence my soul takes delight,
On whom in affliction I call,
My comfort by day and my song in the night,
My hope, my salvation, my all!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Where dost Thou, dear Shepherd, resort with Thy sheep,
To feed them in pastures of love?
Say, why in the valley of death should I weep,
Or alone in this wilderness rove?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O why should I wander an alien from Thee,
Or cry in the desert for bread?
Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,
And smile at the tears I have shed.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have you seen
The star that on Israel shone?
Say, if in your tents my Beloved has been,
And where with His flocks He is gone.</lines>
		</verse>
