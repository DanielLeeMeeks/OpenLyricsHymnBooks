	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There was One who was willing to die in my stead,
That a soul so unworthy might live;
And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,
All the sins of my life to forgive.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>They are nailed to the cross,
They are nailed to the cross,
O how much He was willing to bear!
With what anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross!
But He carried my sins with Him there.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He is tender and loving and patient with me,
While He cleanses my heart of the dross;
But “there’s no condemnation”—-I know I am free,
For my sins are all nailed to the cross. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I will cling to my Savior and never depart--
I will joyfully journey each day.
With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
That my sins have been taken away. </lines>
		</verse>
