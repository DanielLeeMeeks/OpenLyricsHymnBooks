		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>We gather together to ask the Lordâ€™s blessing;
He chastens and hastens His will to make known;
The wicked oppressing cease them from distressing,
Sing praises to His name, He forgets not His own.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Beside us to guide us, our God with us joining
Ordaining, maintaining His kingdom divine;
So from the beginning the fight we were winning,
Thou, Lord, were at our side, the glory be Thine!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>We all do extol Thee, Thou Leader in battle,
And pray that Thou still our Defender wilt be.
Let Thy congregation escape tribulation;
Thy Name be ever praised. O Lord, make us free!
Amen.</lines>
