		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come, we that love the Lord,
And let our joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord
And thus surround the throne,
And thus surround the throne.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Let those refuse to sing
That never knew our God,
But children of the heav'nly King,
But children of the heav'nly King,
May speak their joys abroad,
May speak their joys abroad. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets
Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
Before we reach the heav'nly fields,
Or walk the golden streets,
Or walk the golden streets. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Then let our songs abound,
And ev'ry tear be dry;
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
We're marching thro' Immanuel's ground,
To fairer worlds on high,
To fairer worlds on high. </lines>
		</verse>
