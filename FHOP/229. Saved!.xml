		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Saved! saved! saved! my sins are all forgiv'n;
Christ is mine! I'm on my way to heav'n;
Once a guilty sinner, lost, undone,
Now a child of God, saved thro' His son.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Saved! I'm saved thro' Christ, my all in all;
Saved! I'm saved, whatever may befall;
He died upon the cross for me,
He bore the awful penalty;
And now I'm saved eternally--
I'm saved, saved! saved!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Saved! saved! saved! by grace and grace alone;
Oh, what wondrous love to me was shown,
In my stead Christ Jesus bled and died,
Bore my sins, for me was crucified. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Saved! saved! saved! oh, joy beyond compare!
Christ my life, and I His constant care;
Yielding all and trusting Him alone,
Living now each moment as His own. </lines>
		</verse>
