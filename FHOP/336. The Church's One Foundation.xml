		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The Church’s one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation
By water and the word:
From Heav'n He came and sought her
To be His holy bride;
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Elect from ev'ry nation,
Yet one o’er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation
One Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With ev'ry grace endued.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>'Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace forevermore;
Til, with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great church victorious
Shall be the church at rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won:
O happy ones and holy!
Lord, give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee.
Amen.</lines>
