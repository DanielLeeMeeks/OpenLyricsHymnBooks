		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>My Jesus, as Thou wilt!
O may Thy will be mine;
Into Thy hand of love
I would my all resign.
Thro' sorrow, or thro' joy,
Conduct me as Thine own;
And help me still to say,
My Lord, Thy will be done.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>My Jesus, as Thou wilt!
Tho' seen thro' many a tear,
Let not my star of hope
Grow dim or disappear.
Since Thou on earth hast wept,
And sorrowed oft alone,
If I must weep with Thee,
My Lord, Thy will be done.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>My Jesus, as Thou wilt!
All shall be well for me;
Each changing future scene
I gladly trust with Thee.
Straight to my home above
I travel calmly on,
And sing, in life or death,
"My Lord, Thy will be done."</lines>
		</verse>
