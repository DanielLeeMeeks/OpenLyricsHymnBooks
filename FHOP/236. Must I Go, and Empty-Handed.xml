		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>“Must I go, and empty-handed,”
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>“Must I go, and empty-handed?”
Must I meet my Savior so?
Not one soul with which to greet Him:
Must I empty-handed go?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Not at death I shrink nor falter,
For my Savior saves me now;
But to meet Him empty-handed,
Tho't of that now clouds my brow. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O the years in sinning wasted,
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Savior,
To His will I’d gladly bow. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,
Up and work while yet ’tis day;
Ere the night of death o’ertake thee,
Strive for souls while still you may. </lines>
		</verse>
