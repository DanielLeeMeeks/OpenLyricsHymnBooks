		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There’s a peace in my heart that the world never gave,
A peace it cannot take away;
Tho' the trials of life may surround like a cloud,
I’ve a peace that has come there to stay!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Constantly abiding, Jesus is mine;
Constantly abiding, rapture divine;
He never leaves me lonely, whispers, O, so kind:
“I will never leave thee,” Jesus is mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>All the world seemed to sing of a Savior and King,
When peace sweetly came to my heart;
Troubles all fled away and my night turned to day,
Blessed Jesus, how glorious Thou art! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>This treasure I have in a temple of clay,
While here on His footstool I roam;
But He’s coming to take me some glorious day,
Over there to my heavenly home! </lines>
		</verse>
