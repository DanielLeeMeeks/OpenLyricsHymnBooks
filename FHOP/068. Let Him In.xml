		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There’s a Stranger at the door,
Let Him in;
He has been there oft before,
Let Him in;
Let Him in, ere He is gone,
Let Him in, the Holy One,
Jesus Christ, the Father’s Son,
Let Him in.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Open now to Him your heart,
Let Him in;
If you wait He will depart,
Let Him in;
Let Him in, He is your Friend;
He your soul will sure defend,
He will keep you to the end,
Let Him in.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Hear you now His loving voice?
Let Him in;
Now, oh, now make Him your choice,
Let Him in;
He is standing at your door,
Joy to you He will restore,
And His Name you will adore,
Let Him in.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Now admit the heav’nly Guest,
Let Him in;
He will make for you a feast,
Let Him in;
He will speak your sins forgiv’n,
And when earth ties all are riv’n,
He will take you home to heav’n,
Let Him in.</lines>
		</verse>
