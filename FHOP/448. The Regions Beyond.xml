		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>To the regions beyond I must go, I must go,
Where the story has never been told;
To the millions that never have heard of His love,
I must tell the sweet story of old.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>To the regions beyond I must go, I must go,
Till the world, all the world,
His salvation shall know.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>To the hardest of places He calls me to go,
Never thinking of comfort or ease;
The world may pronounce me a dreamer, a fool,
Enough if the Master I please. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Oh, ye that are spending your leisure and pow'rs
In those pleasures so foolish and fond;
Awake from your selfishness, folly and sin,
And go to the regions beyond. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There are other “lost sheep” that the Master must bring,
And to them must the message be told;
He sends me to gather them out of all lands,
And welcome them back to His fold. </lines>
		</verse>
