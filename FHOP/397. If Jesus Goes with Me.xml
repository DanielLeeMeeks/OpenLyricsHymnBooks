		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>It may be in the valley, where countless dangers hide;
It may be in the sunshine that I, in peace, abide;
But this one thing I know—-if it be dark or fair,
If Jesus is with me,
I’ll go anywhere!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>If Jesus goes with me, I’ll go
Anywhere!
’Tis heaven to me,
Where’er I may be,
If He is there!
I count it a privilege here
His cross to bear,
If Jesus goes with me,
I’ll go
Anywhere!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>It may be I must carry the blessed Word of life
Across the burning deserts to those in sinful strife;
And tho' it be my lot to bear my colors there,
If Jesus goes with me,
I’ll go anywhere! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>But if it be my portion to bear my cross at home,
While others bear their burdens beyond the billow’s foam,
I’ll prove my faith in Him—-confess His judgments fair,
And, if He stays with me,
I’ll stay anywhere! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>It is not mine to question the judgments of my Lord,
It is but mine to follow the leadings of His Word;
But if to go or stay, or whether here or there,
I’ll be, with my Savior,
Content anywhere! </lines>
		</verse>
