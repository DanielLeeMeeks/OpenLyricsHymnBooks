		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There’s a garden where Jesus is waiting,
There’s a place that is wondrously fair;
For it glows with the light of His presence,
’Tis the beautiful garden of prayer.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>O the beautiful garden, the garden of prayer,
O the beautiful garden of prayer;
There my Savior awaits, and He opens the gates
To the beautiful garden of prayer.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>There’s a garden where Jesus is waiting,
And I go with my burden and care,
Just to learn from His lips words of comfort
In the beautiful garden of prayer. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>There’s a garden where Jesus is waiting,
And He bids you to come meet Him there;
Just to bow, and receive a new blessing,
In the beautiful garden of prayer. </lines>
		</verse>
