		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Down at the cross where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His name.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
There to my heart was the blood applied;
Glory to His name.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within,
There at the cross where He took me in;
Glory to His name. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
Glory to His name. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Come to this fountain so rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul at the Savior’s feet;
Plunge in today, and be made complete;
Glory to His name. </lines>
		</verse>
