		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Unto the hills around do I lift up
My longing eyes;
O whence for me shall my salvation come,
From whence arise?
From God, the Lord, doth come my certain aid,
From God, the Lord who heav'n and earth hath made.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He will not suffer that thy foot be moved:
Safe shalt thou be.
No careless slumber shall His eyelids close,
Who keepeth thee.
Behold our God the Lord,
He slumbereth ne'er,
Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true,
Thy changeless shade;
Jehovah thy defense on thy right hand
Himself hath made.
And thee no sun by day shall ever smite;
No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>From every evil shall He keep thy soul,
From every sin;
Jehovah shall preserve thy going out,
Thy coming in.
Above thee watching, He whom we adore
Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, for evermore.</lines>
		</verse>
