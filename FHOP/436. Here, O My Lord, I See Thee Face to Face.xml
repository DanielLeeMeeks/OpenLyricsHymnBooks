		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;
Here would I touch and handle things unseen,
Here grasp with firmer hand th'eternal grace,
And all my weariness upon Thee lean.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Here would I feed upon the bread of God;
Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;
Here would I lay aside each earthly load,
Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;
The feast, tho' not the love, is passed and gone;
The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here--
Nearer than ever--still my Shield and Sun.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Feast after feast thus comes and passes by;
Yet, passing, points to the glad feast above--
Giving sweet foretaste of the festal joy,
The Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.</lines>
		</verse>
