		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I am not skilled to understand
What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand
Is One who is my Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I take Him at His word indeed;
“Christ died for sinners,” this I read;
And in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>That He should leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die,
You count it strange? So once did I,
Before I knew my Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Yea, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring:
That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
