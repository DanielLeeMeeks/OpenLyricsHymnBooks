		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>God has given you His promise
That He hears and answers prayer;
He will heed your supplication
If you cast on Him your care.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He will answer ev'ry prayer,
He will answer ev'ry prayer,
Go to Him in faith believing,
He will answer ev'ry prayer.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He will not withhold one blessing,
He will give you what is best;
God will answer by His Spirit,
Ev'ry one who makes request. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He can hear the great petition,
And the smallest, over there;
Unto God pray without ceasing,
He will answer ev'ry prayer. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Take to God your plans and failures,
Any time and anywhere;
No one e'er has gone unanswered,
For He answers ev'ry prayer. </lines>
		</verse>
