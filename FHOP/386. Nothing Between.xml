		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Nothing between my soul and my Savior,
Naught of this world's delusive dream;
I have renounced all sinful pleasure,
Jesus is mine; there's nothing between.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
So that His blessed face may be seen;
Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
Keep the way clear!
Let nothing between.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Nothing between, like worldly pleasure,
Habits of life though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him e'er sever,
He is my all, there's nothing between. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self or friends shall not intervene,
Tho' it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved; there's nothing between. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,
Tho' the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self denial,
I'll triumph at last, with nothing between. </lines>
		</verse>
