		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Some day the silver cord will break,
And I no more as now shall sing;
But oh, the joy when I shall wake
Within the palace of the King!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story—-Saved by grace;
And I shall see Him face to face,
And tell the story—-Saved by grace.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Some day my earthly house will fall,
I cannot tell how soon ’twill be;
But this I know-—my All in All
Has now a place in heav’n for me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Some day, when fades the golden sun
Beneath the rosy-tinted west,
My blessed Lord will say, “Well done!”
And I shall enter into rest. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Some day: till then I’ll watch and wait,
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,
That when my Savior opes the gate,
My soul to Him may take its flight. </lines>
		</verse>
