		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come, ye faithful, raise the strain
Of triumphant gladness;
God hath brought his Israel
Into joy from sadness.
Loosed from Pharaoh's bitter yoke
Jacob's sons and daughters,
Led them with unmoistened foot
Through the Red Sea waters.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>'Tis the Spring of souls today;
Christ hath burst His prison,
And from three days' sleep in death
As a sun hath risen.
All the Winter of our sins,
Long and dark, is flying
From His light, to whom we give
Laud and praise undying.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Now the queen of seasons, bright
With the day of splendor,
With the royal feast of feasts,
Comes its joy to render;
Comes to glad Jerusalem,
Who with true affection
Welcomes in unwearied strains
Jesus' resurrection.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Alleluia now to Thee,
Christ, our King Immortal,
Who hast passed the gates of death
And the tomb's sealed portal;
Who, though never door unclose,
In th'assembly standing,
Breathest on Thy friends the peace
Past all understanding.
Amen.
Amen.</lines>
		</verse>
