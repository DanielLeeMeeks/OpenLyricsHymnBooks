		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin;
The Light of the world is Jesus;
Like sunshine at noonday his glory shone in,
The Light of the world is Jesus.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Come to the Light, 'tis shining for thee;
Sweetly the Light has dawned upon me;
Once I was blind, but now I can see;
The Light of the world is Jesus.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>No darkness have we who in Jesus abide,
The Light of the world is Jesus;
We walk in the Light when we follow our Guide,
The Light of the world is Jesus. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Ye dwellers in darkness with sin-blinded eyes,
The Light of the world is Jesus;
Go, wash at His bidding, and light will arise,
The Light of the world is Jesus. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>No need of the sunlight in heaven, we're told,
The Light of the world is Jesus;
The Lamb is the Light in the City of Gold,
The Light of the world is Jesus. </lines>
		</verse>
