		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Why do you wait, dear brother,
Oh, why do you tarry so long?
Your Savior is waiting to give you
A place in His sanctified throng.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Why not? why not?
Why not come to Him now?
Why not? why not?
Why not come to Him now?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>What do you hope, dear brother,
To gain by a further delay?
There’s no one to save you but Jesus,
There’s no other way but His way. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Do you not feel, dear brother,
His Spirit now striving within?
Oh, why not accept His salvation,
And throw off your burden of sin? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Why do your wait, dear brother?
The harvest is passing away;
Your Savior is longing to bless you,
There are danger and death in delay. </lines>
		</verse>
