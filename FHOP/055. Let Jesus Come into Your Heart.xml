		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>If you are tired of the load of your sin,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you desire a new life to begin,
Let Jesus come into your heat.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Just now, your doubtings give o'er;
Just now, reject Him no more;
Just now, throw open the door;
Let Jesus come into your heart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>If 'tis for purity now that you sigh,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
Fountains for cleansing are flowing nearby,
Let Jesus come into your heart. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>If there's a tempest your voice cannot still,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If there's a void this world never can fill,
Let Jesus come into your heart. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>If you would join the glad songs of the blest,
Let Jesus come into your heart;
If you would enter the mansions of rest,
Let Jesus come into your heart. </lines>
		</verse>
