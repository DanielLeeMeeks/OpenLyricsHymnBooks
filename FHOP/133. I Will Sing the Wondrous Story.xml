		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I will sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me,
How He left His home in glory
For the cross of Calvary.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me,
Sing it with the saints in glory,
Gathered by the crystal sea.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I was lost but Jesus found me,
Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into His way. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;
Faint was I from many a fall;
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,
But He freed me from them all. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Days of darkness still come o’er me,
Sorrow’s path I often tread,
But the Savior still is with me;
By His hand I’m safely led. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet;
Then He’ll bear me safely over,
Where the loved ones I shall meet. </lines>
		</verse>
