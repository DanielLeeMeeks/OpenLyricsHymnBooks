		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>"Are ye able," said the Master,
"To be crucified with me?"
"Yea," the sturdy dreamers answered,
"To the death we follow Thee."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>"Lord, we are able,"
Our spirits are Thine.
Remold them, make us,
Like Thee, divine:
Thy guiding radiance
Above us shall be
A beacon to God,
To love and loyalty.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>"Are ye able," to remember,
When a thief lifts up his eyes,
That his pardoned soul is worthy
Of a place in paradise? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"Are ye able," when the shadows
Close around you with the sod,
To believe that spirit triumphs,
To commend your soul to God? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>"Are ye able?" Still the Master
Whispers down eternity,
And heroic spirits answer
Now, as then in Galilee. </lines>
		</verse>
