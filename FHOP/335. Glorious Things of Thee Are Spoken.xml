		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
He, whose word cannot be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>See, the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove;
Who can faint, while such a river
Ever will their thirst t'assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord, the Giver,
Never fails from age to age.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Round each habitation hov'ring,
See the cloud and fire appear
For a glory and a cov'ring,
Showing that the Lord is near!
Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
He, whose word cannot be broken,
Formed thee for His own abode.
Amen.</lines>
