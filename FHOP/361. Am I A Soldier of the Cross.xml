		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Am I a soldier of the cross?
A foll'wer of the Lamb,
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Must I be carried to the skies
On flow'ry beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize,
And sailed thro' bloody seas?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Sure I must fight, if I would reign;
Increase my courage, Lord;
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy word.</lines>
		</verse>
