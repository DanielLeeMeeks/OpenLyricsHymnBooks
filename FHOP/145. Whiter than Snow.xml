		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole;
I want Thee forever to live in my soul,
Break down ev'ry idol, cast out ev'ry foe;
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
I give up myself, and whatever I know,
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat,
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;
By faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow,
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait,
Come now, and within me a new heart create;
To those who have sought Thee, Thou never saidst "No,"
Now wash me and I shall be whiter than snow. </lines>
