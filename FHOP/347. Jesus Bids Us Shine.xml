		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus bids us shine,
With a clear, pure light,
Like a little candle
Burning in the night;
In this world of darkness
We must shine,
You in your small corner,
And I in mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus bids us shine,
First of all for Him;
Well He sees and knows it
If our light is dim;
He looks down from heaven,
Sees us shine,
You in your small corner,
And I in mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Jesus bids us shine,
Then, for all around
Many kinds of darkness
In this world abound--
Sin, and want, and sorrow:
We must shine,
You in your small corner,
And I in mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Jesus bids us shine,
As we work for Him,
Bringing those that wander
From the paths of sin;
He will ever help us,
If we shine,
You in your small corner,
And I in mine.</lines>
		</verse>
