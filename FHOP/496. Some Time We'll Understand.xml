		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Not now, but in the coming years,
It may be in the better land,
We'll read the meaning of our tears,
And there, some time, we'll understand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Then trust in God thro' all the days;
Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
Some time, some time, we'll understand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>We'll catch the broken thread again,
Anmd finish what we here began;
Heav'n will the mysteries explain,
And then, ah, then, we'll understand </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>We'll know why clouds instead of sun
Were over many a cherished plan;
Why song has ceased when scarce begun;
'Tis there, some time, we'll understand. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>God knows the way, He holds the key,
He guides us with unerring hand;
Some time with tearless eyes we'll see;
Yes, there, up there, we'll understand. </lines>
		</verse>
