		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I was lost in sin when Jesus found me,
But He rescued me, all glory to His name!
And the cords of worldly pleasure bound me,
Till He saved me from sin and shame.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>’Twas a glad day when Jesus found me,
When His strong arms were thrown around me;
When my sins He buried in the deepest sea,
And my soul He filled with joy and victory,
’Twas a glad day, O hallelujah!
’Twas a glad day He claimed His own;
I will shout a glad hosanna in glory
When I see Him upon His throne.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O the bells of heaven now are ringing,
For I hear their tones within my ransomed soul;
And my heart is filled with joyful singing
Since the Savior has made me whole. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O the joy when we shall meet in glory,
In the mansions of my Father’s home above;
And thro' endless ages tell the story
Of the Savior’s redeeming love. </lines>
		</verse>
