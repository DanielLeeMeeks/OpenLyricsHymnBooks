		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>It may not be on the mountain’s height,
Or over the stormy sea;
It may not be at the battle’s front
My Lord will have need of me;
But if by a still, small voice He calls
To paths I do not know,
I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in Thine,
I’ll go where You want me to go.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
O’er mountain, or plain, or sea;
I’ll say what you want me to say, dear Lord,
I’ll be what you want me to be.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Perhaps today there are loving words
Which Jesus would have me speak;
There may be now in the paths of sin,
Some wand’rer whom I should seek.
O Savior, if Thou wilt be my Guide,
Tho' dark and rugged the way,
My voice shall echo the message sweet,
I’ll say what you want me to say. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>There’s surely somewhere a lowly place
In earth’s harvest fields so wide,
Where I may labor thro' life’s short day
For Jesus, the Crucified;
So, trusting my all to Thy care,
I know Thou lovest me!
I’ll do Thy will with a heart sincere,
I’ll be what you want me to be. </lines>
		</verse>
