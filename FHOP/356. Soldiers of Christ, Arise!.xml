		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Soldiers of Christ, arise,
And put your armor on,
Strong in the strength which God supplies,
Through His eternal Son;
Strong in the Lord of hosts,
And in His mighty pow'r,
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Stand then in His great might,
With all His strength endued,
And take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God;
That having all things done,
And all your conflicts past,
Ye may o'ercome through Christ alone,
And stand entire at last.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Leave no unguarded place,
No weakness of the soul,
Take ev'ry virtue, ev'ry grace,
And fortify the whole,
From strength to strength go on,
Wrestle and fight and pray;
Tread all the pow'rs of darkness down,
And win the well-fought day.</lines>
		</verse>
