		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>To God be the glory--great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
And opened the Lifegate that all may go in.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice!
O come to the Father thro' Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory--great things He hath done!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus forgiveness receives. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing thro' Jesus the Son;
But purer and higher and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see. </lines>
		</verse>
