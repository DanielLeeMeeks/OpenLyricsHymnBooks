		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>All creatures of our God and King,
Lift up your voice and with us sing
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou burning sun with golden beam,
Thou silver moon with softer gleam!
O praise Him, O praise Him,
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Thou rushing wind that art so strong,
Ye clouds that sail in heav'n along,
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice,
Ye lights of evening, find a voice!
O praise Him, O praise Him,
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>And all ye men of tender heart,
Forgiving others, take your part,
O sing ye! Alleluia!
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear,
Praise God and on Him cast your care!
O praise Him, O praise Him,
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Let all things their Creator bless,
And worship Him in humbleness,
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son,
And praise the Spirit, Three in One!
O praise Him, O praise Him,
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
* Praise God from whom all blessings flow,
Praise Him all creatures here below,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Praise Him above, ye heav'nly host,
Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Amen.
*Sometimes called the "Keswick Doxology"</lines>
