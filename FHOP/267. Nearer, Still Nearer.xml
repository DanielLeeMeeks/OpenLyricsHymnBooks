		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Nearer, still nearer, close to Thy heart,
Draw me, my Savior, so precious Thou art;
Fold me, O fold me close to Thy breast,
Shelter me safe in that “Haven of Rest,”
Shelter me safe in that “Haven of Rest.”</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Nearer, still nearer, nothing I bring,
Naught as an off'ring to Jesus, my King;
Only my sinful, now contrite heart,
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart,
Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Nearer, still nearer, Lord, to be Thine,
Sin with its follies I gladly resign;
All of its pleasures, pomp and its pride,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord, crucified,
Give me but Jesus, my Lord, crucified.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Nearer, still nearer, while life shall last,
Till safe in glory my anchor is cast;
Thro' endless ages ever to be,
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee,
Nearer, my Savior, still nearer to Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
