		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O could I speak the matchless worth,
O could I sound the glories forth
Which in my Savior shine,
I'd soar and touch the heav'nly strings,
And vie with Gabriel while he sings
In notes almost divine,
In notes almost divine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I'd sing the precious blood He spilt,
My ransom from the dreadful guilt
Of sin, and wrath divine;
I'd sing His glorious righteousness,
In which all-perfect, heav'nly dress
My soul shall ever shine,
My soul shall ever shine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I'd sing the characters He bears,
And all the forms of love He wears,
Exalted on His throne;
In loftiest songs of sweetest praise,
I would to everlasting days
Make all His glories known,
Make all His glories known.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Well, the delightful day will come
When my dear Lord will bring me home,
And I shall see His face;
Then with my Saviour, Brother, Friend,
A blest eternity I'll spend,
Triumphant in His grace,
Triumphant in His grace.</lines>
		</verse>
