		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Safely through another week
God has brought us on our way;
Let us now a blessing seek,
Waiting in His courts today;
Day of all the week the best,
Emblem of eternal rest:
Day of all the week the best,
Emblem of eternal rest.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>While we pray for pard'ning grace,
Thro' the dear Redeemer's name,
Show Thy reconciled face;
Take away our sin and shame;
From our worldly cares set free,
May we rest this day in Thee:
From our worldly cares set free,
May we rest this day in Thee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Here we come Thy name to praise,
Let us feel thy presence near;
May Thy glory meet our eyes,
While we in Thy house appear:
Here afford us, Lord, a taste
Of our everlasting feast:
Here afford us, Lord, a taste
Of our everlasting feast.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>May Thy gospel's joyful sound
Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
May the fruits of grace abound,
Bring relief for all complaints:
Thus may all our Sabbaths prove,
Till we join the church above:
Thus may all our Sabbaths prove,
Till we join the church above.</lines>
		</verse>
