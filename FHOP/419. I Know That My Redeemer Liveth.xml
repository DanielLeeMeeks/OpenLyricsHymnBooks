		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I know that my Redeemer liveth,
And on the earth again shall stand;
I know eternal life He giveth,
That grace and pow'r are in His hand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I know, I know that Jesus liveth,
And on the earth again shall stand.
I know, I know that life He giveth,
That grace and pow'r are in His hand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I know his promise never faileth,
The word He speaks, it cannot die;
Tho' cruel death my flesh assaileth,
Yet I shall see Him by and by. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I know my mansion He prepareth,
That where He is there I may be;
O wondrous tho't, for me He careth,
And He at last will come for me. </lines>
