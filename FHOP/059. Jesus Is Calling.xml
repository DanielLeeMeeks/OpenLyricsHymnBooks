		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus is tenderly calling thee home--
Calling today, calling today;
Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam
Farther and farther away?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Calling today,
Calling today,
Jesus is calling,
Is tenderly calling today.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus is calling the weary to rest--
Calling today, calling today;
Bring Him thy burden and thou shalt be blest;
He will not turn thee away. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Jesus is waiting; O come to Him now--
Waiting today, waiting today;
Come with thy sins; at His feet lowly bow;
Come, and no longer delay. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Jesus is pleading; O list to his voice;
Hear Him today, hear Him today;
They who believe on His name shall rejoice;
Quickly arise and away. </lines>
		</verse>
