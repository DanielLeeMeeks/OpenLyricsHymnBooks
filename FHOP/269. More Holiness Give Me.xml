		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>More holiness give me,
More striving within;
More patience in suff'ring,
More sorrow for sin;
More faith in my Savior,
More sense of His care;
More joy in His service,
More purpose in prayer.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>More gratitude give me,
More trust in the Lord;
More pride in His glory,
More hope in His word;
More tears for His sorrows,
More pain at His grief;
More meekness in trial,
More praise for relief.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>More purity give me,
More strength to o’ercome;
More freedom from earth-stains,
More longings for home;
More fit for the kingdom,
More used would I be;
More blessèd and holy,
More, Savior, like Thee.</lines>
