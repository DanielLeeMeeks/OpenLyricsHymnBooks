		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
All seated on the ground,
The angel of the Lord came down,
And glory shone around,
And glory shone around.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>"Fear not!" said he; for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled mind,
"Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind,
To you and all mankind.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"To you, in David's town this day
Is born of David's line,
The Savior who is Christ the Lord;
And this shall be the sign:
And this shall be the sign:</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>"The heav'nly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed,
All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
And in a manger laid,
And in a manger laid.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>"All glory be to God on high,
And to the earth be peace;
Good will henceforth from heav'n to men,
Begin and never cease,
Begin and never cease."</lines>
		</verse>
