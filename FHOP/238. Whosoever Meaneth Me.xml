		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I am happy today and the sun shines bright,
The clouds have been rolled away;
For the Savior said Whosoever will,
May come with Him to stay.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>“Whosoever” surely meaneth me,
Surely meaneth me, O surely meaneth me;
“Whosoever” surely meaneth me,
“Whosoever” meaneth me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>All my hopes have been raised, O His Name be praised,
His glory has filled my soul;
I’ve been lifted up and from sin set free,
His blood hath made me whole. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O what wonderful love, O what grace divine,
That Jesus should die for me!
I was lost in sin, for the world I pined,
But now I am set free. </lines>
		</verse>
