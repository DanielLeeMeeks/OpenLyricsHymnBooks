		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>He leadeth me, O blessed tho't!
O words with heav'nly comfort fraught!
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He leadeth me, He leadeth me!
By His own hand He leadeth me!
His faithful foll'wer I would be,
For by His hand He leadeth me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
By waters still, o'er troubled sea,--
Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur nor repine;
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since 'tis my God that leadeth me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>And when my task on earth is done,
When by Thy grace the vict'ry's won,
E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me. </lines>
		</verse>
