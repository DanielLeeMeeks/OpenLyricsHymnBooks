		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Art thou weary, art thou languid,
At thou sore distressed?
"Come to Me," saith One, "and coming,
Be at rest."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Hath He marks to lead me to Him,
If He be my Guide?
In His feet and hands are wound-prints,
And His side."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Is there diadem, as Monarch,
That His brow adorns?
Yea, a crown, in very surety,
But of thorns.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>If I ask Him to receive me,
Will He say me nay?
Not till earth and not till heaven
Pass away.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Finding, foll'wing, keeping, struggling,
Is He sure to bless?
Saints, apostles, prophets, martyrs,
Answer, "Yes."
Amen.</lines>
		</verse>
