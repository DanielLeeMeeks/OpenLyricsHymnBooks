		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I know not why God’s wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy--Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>But “I know whom I have believed,
And am persuaded that He is able
To keep that which I’ve committed
Unto Him against that day.”</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word
Wrought peace within my heart. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus thro' His Word,
Creating faith in Him. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noonday fair,
Nor if I walk the vale with Him,
Or "meet Him in the air." </lines>
		</verse>
