		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
Nor riches of earth could have saved my poor soul;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior now maketh me whole.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I am redeemed, but not with silver;
I am bought, but not with gold;
Bought with a price--the blood of Jesus,
Precious price of love untold.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior could only atone. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The holy commandment forbade me draw near;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior removeth my fear. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption,
The way into heaven could not thus be bought;
The blood of the cross is my only foundation,
The death of my Savior redemption hath wrought. </lines>
		</verse>
