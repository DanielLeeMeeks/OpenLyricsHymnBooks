		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Why should I charge my soul with care?
The wealth of ev'ry mine
Belongs to Christ, God’s Son and Heir,
And He’s a Friend of mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Yes, He’s a Friend of mine,
And He with me doth all things share;
Since all is Christ’s, and Christ is mine,
Why should I have a care?
For Jesus is a Friend of mine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The silver moon, the golden sun,
The countless stars that shine,
Are His alone, yes, ev'ry one,
And He’s a Friend of mine. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He daily spreads a glorious feast,
And at His table dine
The whole creation, man and beast,
And He’s a Friend of mine. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>And when He comes in bright array,
And leads the conquering line,
It will be glory then to say,
And He’s a Friend of mine. </lines>
		</verse>
