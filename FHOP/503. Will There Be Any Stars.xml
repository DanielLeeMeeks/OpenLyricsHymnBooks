		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I am thinking today of that beautiful land
I shall reach when the sun goeth down;
When thro' wonderful grace by my Savior I stand,
Will there be any stars in my crown?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Will there be any stars, any stars in my crown
When at evening the sun goeth down?
When I wake with the blest
In the mansions of rest,
Will there be any stars in my crown?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>In the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray,
Let me watch as a winner of souls;
That bright stars may be mine in the glorious day,
When His praise like the sea-billow rolls. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Oh, what joy it will be when His face I behold,
Living gems at His feet to lay down;
It would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold,
Should there be any stars in my crown. </lines>
		</verse>
