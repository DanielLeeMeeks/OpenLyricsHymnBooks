		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>In the land of fadeless day
Lies the "city four-square;"
It shall never pass away,
And there is "no night there."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>God shall "wipe away all tears;"
There's no death, no pain, nor fears;
And they count not time by years,
For there is "no night there."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>All the gates of pearl are made
In the "city four-square;"
All the streets with gold are laid,
And there is "no night there." </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>And the gates shall never close
To the "city four-square;"
There life's crystal river flows,
And there is "no night there." </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There they need no sunshine bright,
In that "city four-square;"
For the Lamb is all the light,
And there is "no night there." </lines>
		</verse>
