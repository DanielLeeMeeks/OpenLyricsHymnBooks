		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I wandered in the shades of night,
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Sunlight, sunlight in my soul today,
Sunlight, sunlight all along the way;
Since the Savior found me
Took away my sin,
I have had the sunlight of His love within.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Tho' clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigor on,
And leave the world behind. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I cross the wide-extended fields,
I journey o'er the plain,
And in the sunlight of His love
I reap the golden grain. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The light that came to me,
Behold the brightness of His face,
Thro'out eternity. </lines>
		</verse>
