		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Arise, my soul, arise,
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding Sacrifice
In my behalf appears;
Before the Throne my Surety stands,
Before the Throne my Surety stands,:
My name is written on his hands.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He ever lives above,
For me to intercede,
His all-redeeming love,
His precious blood to plead;
His blood atoned for all our race,
His blood atoned for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Five bleeding wounds he bears,
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers,
They strongly plead for me:
"Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,
"Forgive him, O forgive," they cry,
"Nor let that ransomed sinner die!"</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>My God is reconciled;
His pard'ning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child,
I can no longer fear;
With confidence I now draw nigh,
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And "Father, Abba, Father!" cry.
Amen.</lines>
