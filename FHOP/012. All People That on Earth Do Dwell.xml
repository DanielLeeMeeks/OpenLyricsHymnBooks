	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>All people that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice;
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell;
Come ye before Him and rejoice.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;
Without our aid He did us make;
We are His flock, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>O enter then His gates with praise;
Approach with joy His courts unto;
Praise laud and bless His Name always,
For it is seemly so to do.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>For why? the Lord our God is good,
His mercy is for ever sure;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.
Amen.</lines>
		</verse>
