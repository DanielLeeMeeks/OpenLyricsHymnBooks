		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I was straying when Christ found me
In the night so dark and cold;
Tenderly His arm went around me,
And He bore me to His fold.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Precious hiding place,
Precious hiding place,
In the shelter of His love;
Not a doubt or fear,
Since my Lord is near,
And I'm sheltered in His love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>With His nail-scarred hand He bro't me
To the shelter of His love;
Of His grace and will He taught me,
And of heav'nly rest above. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Tho' the night be dark around me
I am safe, for He is near;
Never shall my foes confound me,
While the Savior's voice I hear. </lines>
		</verse>
