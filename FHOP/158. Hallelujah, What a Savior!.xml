		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>"Man of Sorrows," what a name
For the Son of God who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim!
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood;
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Guilty, vile and helpless, we;
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
"Full atonement!" can it be?
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Lifted up was He to die,
"It is finished," was His cry;
Now in heav'n exalted high;
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>When He comes, our glorious King,
All His ransomed home to bring,
Then anew this song we'll sing:
Hallelujah! what a Savior!</lines>
		</verse>
