		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us forever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Blessed quietness, holy quietness,
What assurance in my soul!
On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me,
How the billows cease to roll!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Bringing life and health and gladness,
All around this heav'nly Guest,
Banished unbelief and sadness,
Changed our weariness to rest. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming on us from on high. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>See, a fruitful field is growing,
Blessed fruit of righteousness;
And the streams of life are flowing
In the lonely wilderness. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>What a wonderful salvation,
Where we always see His face!
What a peaceful habitation,
What a quiet resting-place! </lines>
		</verse>
