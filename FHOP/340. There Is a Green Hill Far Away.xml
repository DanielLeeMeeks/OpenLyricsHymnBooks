		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>O dearly, dearly has He loved,
And we must love Him, too;
And trust in His redeeming blood,
And try His works to do.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>We may not know we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us
He hung and suffered there. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He died that we might be forgiv'n,
He died to make us good,
That we might go at last to Heav'n,
Saved by His precious blood. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There was no other good enough,
To pay the price of sin;
He only could unlock the gate
Of Heav'n and let us in. </lines>
		</verse>
