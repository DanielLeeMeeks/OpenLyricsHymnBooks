	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>More like the Master I would ever be,
More of His meekness, more humility;
More zeal to labor, more courage to be true,
More consecration for work He bids me do.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Take Thou my heart, I would be Thine alone;
Take Thou my heart and make it all Thine own;
Purge me from sin, O Lord, I now implore,
Wash me and keep me Thine forevermore.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>More like the Master is my daily prayer;
More strength to carry crosses I must bear;
More earnest effort to bring His kingdom in,
More of His Spirit, the wanderer to win. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>More like the Master I would live and grow;
More of His love to others I would show;
More self-denial, like His in Galilee,
More like the Master I long to ever be. </lines>
		</verse>
