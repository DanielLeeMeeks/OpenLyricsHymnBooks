		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Throw out the Life-Line across the dark wave;,
There is a brother whom someone should save;
Somebody’s brother! oh, who then will dare
To throw out the Life-Line, his peril to share?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is drifting away;
Throw out the Life-Line!
Throw out the Life-Line!
Someone is sinking today.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Throw out the Life-Line with hand quick and strong:
Why do you tarry, why linger so long?
See! he is sinking; oh, hasten today
And out with the Life-Boat! away, then, away! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Throw out the Life-Line to danger-fraught men,
Sinking in anguish where you’ve never been:
Winds of temptation and billows of woe
Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Soon will the season of rescue be o’er,
Soon will they drift to eternity’s shore,
Haste then, my brother, no time for delay,
But throw out the Life-Line and save them today. </lines>
		</verse>
