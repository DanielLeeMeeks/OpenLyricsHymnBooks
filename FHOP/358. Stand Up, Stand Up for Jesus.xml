		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
Ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss:
From vict'ry unto vict'ry,
His army shall He lead,
Till ev'ry foe is vanquished
And Christ is Lord indeed.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
The trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day.
"Ye that are men now serve Him"
Against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Stand up, stand up for Jesus,
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you--
Ye dare not trust your own:
Put on the gospel armor,
Each piece put on with prayer;
Where duty calls, or danger,
Be never wanting there.</lines>
		</verse>
