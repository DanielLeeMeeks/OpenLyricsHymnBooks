		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,
Calling for you and for me;
See, on the portals He’s waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Come home, come home,
Ye who are weary, come home;
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me?
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
Mercies for you and for me? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,
Passing from you and from me;
Shadows are gathering, death-beds are coming,
Coming for you and for me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Oh! for the wonderful love He has promised,
Promised for you and for me;
Tho' we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me. </lines>
		</verse>
