		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Christ our Redeemer died on the cross,
Died for the sinner, paid all his due;
Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the Lamb,
And I will pass, will pass over you.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
When I see the blood,
I will pass, I will pass over you.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save;
As He has promised, that He will do;
Wash in the fountain opened for sin,
And I will pass, will pass over you. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Judgment is coming, all will be there,
Each one receiving justly his due;
Hide in the saving sin-cleasing blood,
And I will pass, will pass over you. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O great compassion! O boundless love!
O loving kindness, faithful and true!
Find peace and shelter under the blood,
And I will pass, will pass over you. </lines>
		</verse>
