		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There's a church in the valley by the wildwood,
No lovelier spot in the dale;
No place is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Come to the church in the wildwood,
Oh, come to the church in the vale;
No spot is so dear to my childhood
As the little brown church in the vale.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Oh, come to the church in the wildwood,
To the trees where the wild flowers bloom;
Where the parting hymn will be chanted,
We will weep by the side of the tomb. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>How sweet on a clear Sunday morning,
To list to the clear ringing bell;
Its tones so sweetly are calling,
Oh, come to the church in the vale. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>From the church in the valley by the wildwood,
When day fades away into might,
I would fain from this spot of my childhood
Wing my way to the mansions of light. </lines>
		</verse>
