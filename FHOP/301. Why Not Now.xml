		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>While we pray and while we plead,
While you see your soul’s deep need,
While our Father calls you home,
Will you not, my brother, come?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Why not now? Why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?
Why not now? Why not now?
Why not come to Jesus now?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>You have wandered far away;
Do not risk another day;
Do not turn from God thy face,
But today accept His grace. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>In the world you’ve failed to find
Aught of peace for troubled mind;
Come to Christ, on Him believe,
Peace and joy you shall receive. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Come to Christ, confession make;
Come to Christ, and pardon take;
Trust in Him from day to day,
He will keep you all the way. </lines>
		</verse>
