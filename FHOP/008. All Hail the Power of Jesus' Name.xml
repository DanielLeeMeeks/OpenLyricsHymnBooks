		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>All hail the pow'r of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all,
Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown him Lord of all,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace,
And crown him Lord of all!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Let ev'ry kindred, ev'ry tribe
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown him Lord of all,
To Him all majesty ascribe,
And crown him Lord of all!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>O that with yonder sacred throng
We at His feet may fall!
We'll join the everlasting song
and crown Him Lord of all,
We'll join the everlasting song
And crown Him Lord of all!</lines>
