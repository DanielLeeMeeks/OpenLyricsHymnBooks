		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Now thank we all our God
With heart and hands and voices,
Who wondrous things hath done,
In whom His world rejoices;
Who from our mother's arms
Hath blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours today.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O may this bounteous God
Thro' all our life be near us,
With ever joyful hearts,
And blessed peace to cheer us;
And keep us in His grace,
And guide us when perplexed,
And free us from all ills
In this world and the next.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given,
The Son and Him who reigns
With them in highest heaven;
The one eternal God,
Whom earth and heaven adore;
For thus it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.
Amen.</lines>
