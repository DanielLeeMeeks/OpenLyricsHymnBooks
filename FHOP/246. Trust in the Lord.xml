		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart,"
This is God's gracious command;
"In all thy ways acknowledge Him,
So shalt thou dwell in the land."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>"Trust in the Lord," O troubled soul,
Rest in the arms of His care;
Whatever thy lot, it mattereth not,
For nothing can trouble thee there;
"Trust in the Lord," O troubled soul,
Nothing can trouble you there.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>"Trust in the Lord" who ruleth all,
Seeth all things as they are,
Be it a birdling in its nest,
Or yonder uttermost star. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"Trust in the Lord" and peaceful be,
Fret not thy spirit in vain,
What tho' the answer tarries long,
Still shalt hou praise Him again. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>"Trust in the Lord"--His eye will guide
All thro' your pathway ahead,
He hath redeemed and He will keep,
Trust Him and be not afraid. </lines>
		</verse>
