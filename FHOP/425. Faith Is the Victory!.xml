		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Encamped along the hills of light,
Ye Christian soldiers, rise,
And press the battle ere the night
Shall veil the glowing skies.
Against the foe in vales below,
Let all our strength be hurled;
Faith is the victory, we know,
That overcomes the world.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Faith is the victory!
Faith is the victory!
Oh, glorious victory,
That overcomes the world.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>His banner over us is love,
Our sword the Word of God;
We tread the road the saints above
With shouts of triumph trod.
By faith they, like a whirlwind's breath,
Swept on o'er ev'ry field;
The faith by which they conquered Death
Is still our shining shield. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>On ev'ry hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array;
Let tents of ease be left behind,
And--onward to the fray;
Salvation's helmet on each head,
With truth all girt about,
The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
And echo with our shout. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>To him that overcomes the foe
White raiment shall be giv'n;
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in heav'n.
Then onward from the hills of light,
Our hearts with love aflame,
We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus' conquering name. </lines>
		</verse>
