		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Fight the good fight with all thy might!
Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;
Lay hold on life, and it shall be
Thy joy and crown eternally.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Run the straight race thro' God's good grace,
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face;
Life with its way before us lies,
Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide,
His boundless mercy will provide;
Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Faint not nor fear, His arms are near,
He changeth not, and thou art dear;
Only believe, and thou shalt see
That Christ is all in all to thee.
Amen.</lines>
