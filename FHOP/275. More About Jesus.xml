		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>More about Jesus, let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>More about Jesus; in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>More about Jesus on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdomâ€™s sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace. </lines>
