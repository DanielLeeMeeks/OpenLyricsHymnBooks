		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day;
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O happy bond, that seals my vows
To him who merits all my love!
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,
While to that sacred shrine I move. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>'Tis done: the great transaction's done;
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me, and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the call divine. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Now rest, my long-divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Nor ever from my Lord depart,
With Him of ev'ry good possessed. </lines>
		</verse>
