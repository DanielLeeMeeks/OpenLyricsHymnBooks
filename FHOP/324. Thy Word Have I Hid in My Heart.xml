			<lines>Thy Word is a lamp to my feet,
A light to my path alway,
To guide and to save me from sin,
And show me the heav'nly way.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Thy Word have I hid in my heart,
That I might not sin against thee;
That I might not sin, that I might not sin,
Thy Word have I hid in my heart.</lines>
		</verse>

			<lines>Forever, O Lord, is Thy Word
Established and fixed on high;
Thy faithfulness unto all men
Abideth for ever nigh. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>At morning, at noon, and at night
I ever will give Thee praise;
For Thou art my portion, O Lord,
And shall be thro' all my days! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Thro' Him whom Thy Word hath foretold,
The Savior and Morning Star,
Salvation and peace have been bro't
To those who have strayed afar. </lines>
