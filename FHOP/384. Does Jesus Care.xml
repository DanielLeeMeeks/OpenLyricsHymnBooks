		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth and song;
As the burdens press and the cares distress,
And the way grows weary and long?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>O yes, He cares; I know He cares,
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long nights dreary,
I know my Savior cares.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Does Jesus care when I’ve tried and failed
To resist some temptation strong;
When for my deep grief there is no relief,
Tho' my tears flow all the night long? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Does Jesus care when I’ve said "goodbye"
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks—-
Is it aught to Him? Does He see? </lines>
		</verse>
