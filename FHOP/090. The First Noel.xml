		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,
Born is the King of Israel.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>And by the light of that same Star,
Three wise came from country far;
To seek for a King was their intent,
And to follow the Star wherever it went. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>This Star drew nigh to the northwest;,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Then entered in those wise men three,
Full rev'rently upon the knee,
And offered there in His presence
Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense. </lines>
		</verse>
