		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!
Christ, the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See His banners go!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>At the sign of triumph
Satan's host doth flee;
On, then, Christian soldiers
On to victory!
Hell's foundation quiver
At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God;
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided;
All one body we,
One in hope, and doctrine,
One in charity. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Onward, then, ye people,
Join our happy throng,
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song;
Glory, laud, and honor,
Unto Christ the King:
This thro' countless ages
Men and angels sing. </lines>
