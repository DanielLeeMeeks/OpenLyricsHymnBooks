		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>"Tho' your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Tho' your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Tho' they be red like crimson,
They shall be as wool!"
"Tho' your sins be as scarlet,
Tho' your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow,
They shall be as white as snow."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Hear the voice that entreats you,
O return ye unto God!
Hear the voice that entreats you,
O return ye unto God!
He is great compassion,
And of wondrous love;
Hear the voice that entreats you,
Hear the voice that entreats you,
O return ye unto God!
O return ye unto God!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>He'll forgive your transgressions,
And remember them no more;
He'll forgive your transgressions,
And remember them no more;
"Look unto Me, ye people,"
Saith the Lord your God!
He'll forgive your transgressions
He'll forgive your transgressions,
And remember them no more,
And remember them no more.</lines>
