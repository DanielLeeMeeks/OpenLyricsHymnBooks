		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>A sinner, lost, condemned was I,
Doomed an eternal death to die;
But Jesus died for me,
He bore sin's penalty;
On Calv'ry's hill was lifted high.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>'Twas Jesus' blood that ransomed me,
From chains of sin He set me free.
While ages roll, my song shall be:
'Twas Jesus' blood that ransomed me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I ne'er could be at peace with God,
But for the cleansing, crimson flood,
No one but Christ would win
Atonement for all sin--
He signed my pardon with His blood. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>No doubter's scorn or creed of man
Can shake my faith in Calv'ry's plan;
His blood redeemed my soul,
It made me pure and whole;
By faith my life in Him began. </lines>
		</verse>
