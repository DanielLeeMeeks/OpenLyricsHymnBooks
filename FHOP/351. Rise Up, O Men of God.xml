		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Rise up, O men of God!
Have done with lesser things;
Give heart and mind and soul and strength
To serve the King of kings.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Rise up, O men of God!
His Kingdom tarries long;
Bring in the day of brotherhood
And end the night of wrong.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Rise up, O men of God!
The Church for you doth wait,
Her strength unequal to her task;
Rise up, and make her great!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Lift high the cross of Christ!
Tread where His feet have trod;
As brothers of the Son of man,
Rise up, O men of God!</lines>
		</verse>
