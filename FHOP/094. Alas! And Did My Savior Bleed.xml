		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Alas! and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sov'reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For sinners such as I?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Was it for crimes that I have done,
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself to Thee--
'Tis all that I can do.</lines>
		</verse>
