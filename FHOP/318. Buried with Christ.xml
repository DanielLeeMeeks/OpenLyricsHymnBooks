	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Buried with Christ and raised with Him too,
What is there left for me to do?
Simply to cease from struggling and strife,
Simply to walk in newness of life.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Buried with Christ and dead unto sin;
Dying but living, Jesus within;
Ruling and reigning day after day,
Guiding and keeping all of the way.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Risen with Christ my glorious Head,
Holiness now the pathway I tread;
Beautiful thought from walking therein,
He that is dead is freed from all sin. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Living with Christ, who dieth no more,
Following Christ, who goeth before;
Not under law, Iâ€™m now under grace,
Sin is dethroned, and Christ takes its place. </lines>
		</verse>
