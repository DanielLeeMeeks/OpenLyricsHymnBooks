		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When Jesus comes to reward His servants,
Whether it be noon or night,
Faithful to Him will He find us watching,
With our lamps all trimmed and bright?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Oh, can we say we are ready, brother?
Ready for the soul’s bright home?
Say, will He find you and me still watching,
Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>If, at the dawn of the early morning,
He shall call us one by one,
When to the Lord we restore our talents,
Will He answer thee--“Well done”? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Have we been true to the trust He left us?
Do we seek to do our best?
If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,
We shall have a glorious rest. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching,
In His glory they shall share;
If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,
Will He find us watching there? </lines>
		</verse>
