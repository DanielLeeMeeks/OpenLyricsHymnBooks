		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner, condemned, unclean.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>How marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
How marvelous! how wonderful!
Is my Savior's love for me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>For me it was in the garden
He prayed, "Not My will, but Thine;"
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat-drops of blood for mine. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night. 
Amen.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>He took my sins and my sorrow,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered, and died alone. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
'Twill be my joy thro' the ages
To sing of His love for me. </lines>
		</verse>
