		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His Word;
Just to rest upon His promise,
And to know, “Thus saith the Lord.”</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I’ve proved Him o’er and o’er!
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
O for grace to trust Him more!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
And in simple faith to plunge me
’Neath the healing, cleansing flood! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Yes, ’tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life and rest, and joy and peace. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I’m so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end. </lines>
		</verse>
