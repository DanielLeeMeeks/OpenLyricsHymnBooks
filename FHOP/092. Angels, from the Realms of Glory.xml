		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Angels, from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye, who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
Come and worship, come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Shepherds in the fields abiding,
Watching o'er your flocks by night,
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the Infant-Light;
Come and worship, come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Sages, leave your contemplations,
Brighter visions beam afar;
Seek the great Desire of nations,
Ye have seen His natal star;
Come and worship, come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Saints, before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear;
Come and worship, come and worship,
Worship Christ, the newborn King.</lines>
		</verse>
