		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>The trial of the cross was approaching
With its bitterness, sorrow and pain,
When there in the upper room, Jesus
Spoke with His disciples again.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>This do in remembrance of Me,
This do in remembrance of Me;
The wine and the bread speak of blood that was shed;
This do in remembrance of Me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Then take of the bread to remember
That His body was broken for you;
And drink of the cup to remember
His blood that was shed for you too. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The Saviour now liveth in glory,
Triumphant o'er death and o'er sin;
Until He shall come for His dear ones,
Do this in remembrance of Him.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Do this in remembrance of Him,
Do this in remembrance of Him;
The wine and the bread speak of blood that was shed;
Do this in remembrance of Him.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The Son of God gave to His children
This token in mem'ry of Him;
Come, take of the bread of life freely,
And let His blood cleanse you from sin. </lines>
		</verse>
