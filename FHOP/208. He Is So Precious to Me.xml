		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>So precious is Jesus, my Savior, my King,
His praise all the day long with rapture I sing;
To Him in my weakness for strength I can cling,
For He is so precious to me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>For He is so precious to me,
For He is so precious to me;
’Tis heaven below my Redeemer to know,
For He is so precious to me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He stood at my heart’s door ’mid sunshine and rain,
And patiently waited an entrance to gain;
What shame that so long He entreated in vain,
For He is so precious to me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I stand on the mountain of blessing at last,
No cloud in the heavens a shadow to cast;
His smile is upon me, the valley is past,
For He is so precious to me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I praise Him because He appointed a place
Where some day, thro' faith in His wonderful grace,
I know I shall see Him--shall look on His face,
For He is so precious to me. 
Amen.</lines>
