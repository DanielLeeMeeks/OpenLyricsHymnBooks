		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne;
Hark! how the heav'nly anthem drowns
All music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Thro' all eternity.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Crown Him the Lord of love!
Behold His hands and side,
Rich wounds, yet visible above,
In beauty glorified:
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his wond'ring eye
At mysteries so bright.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Crown Him the Lord of life!
Who triumphed o'er the grave;
Who rose victorious to the strife
For those He came to save:
His glories now we sing,
Who died and rose on high;
Who died eternal life to bring,
And lives that death may die.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Crown Him the Lord of Heav'n!
One with the Father known,
One with the Spirit through Him giv'n
From yonder glorious throne!
To Thee be endless praise,
For Thou for us hast died;
Be Thou, O Lord, thro' endless days
Adored and magnified.
Amen.</lines>
