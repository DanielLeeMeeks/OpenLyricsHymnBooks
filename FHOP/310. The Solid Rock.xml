		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In ev'ry high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne. </lines>
		</verse>
