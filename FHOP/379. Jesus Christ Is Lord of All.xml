		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Heav'n and earth proclaim
Jesus Christ is Lord of all;
King of Kings is He
Whom angel hosts adore!
Let men and nations bring
Praises to Christ the King,
Who over all shall reign
Forevermore.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Sing, my heart, oh praise His name;
Jesus Christ is Lord of all!
Sing, ye saints, His grace proclaim;
Jesus Christ is Lord of all!
At His word the grave will open,
At His feet death's bonds will fall.
King of Kings, the mighty God,
Jesus Christ is Lord of all!
Jesus Christ is Lord of all!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Glorious is His name
Giv'n by God in heav'n above.
Name above all names,
And evermore shall be.
Come ev'ry knee, and bow,
Come ev'ry tongue, confess
That Jesus Christ is Lord
Eternally </lines>
