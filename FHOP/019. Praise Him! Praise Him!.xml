			<lines>Praise Him! praise Him!
Jesus, our blessèd Redeemer!
Sing, O Earth, His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him! hail Him! highest archangels in glory;
Strength and honor give to His holy name!
Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His children,
In His arms He carries them all day long:</lines>

For our sins He suffered, and bled, and died;

Love unbounded, wonderful, deep and strong: </lines>

Christ is coming! over the world victorious,
Pow'r and glory unto the Lord belong: </lines>
