		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
And thus He bound me to Him;
And round my heart still closely twine
Those ties which naught can sever,
For I am His, and He is mine,
For ever and for ever.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own Self He gave me.
Naught that I have mine own I call,
I’ll hold it for the Giver;
My heart, my strength, my life, my all
Are His, and His for ever.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend!
All pow'r to Him is given,
To guard me on my onward course,
And bring me safe to heaven:
Eternal glories gleam afar,
To nerve my faint endeavor;
So now to watch, to work, to war;
And then to rest forever.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I’ve found a Friend; oh, such a Friend,
So kind and true and tender!
So wise a Counsellor and Guide,
So mighty a Defender!
From Him who loves me now so well
What power my soul shall sever?
Shall life or death, shall earth or hell?
No; I am His forever.</lines>
		</verse>
