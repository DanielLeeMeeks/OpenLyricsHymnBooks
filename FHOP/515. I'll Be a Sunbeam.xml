		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus wants me for a sunbeam,
To shine for Him each day;
In ev'ry way try to please Him,
At home, at school, at play.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>A sunbeam, a sunbeam,
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam;
A sunbeam, a sunbeam,
I’ll be a sunbeam for Him.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus wants me to be loving,
And kind to all I see;
Showing how pleasant and happy,
His little one can be. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I will ask Jesus to help me
To keep my heart from sin;
Ever reflecting His goodness,
And always shine for Him. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I’ll be a sunbeam for Jesus;
I can if I but try;
Serving Him moment by moment,
Then live with Him on high. </lines>
		</verse>
