		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
And the burden of the day.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eyes at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart with tears
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love
And my own worthlessness.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I take, O cross thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.</lines>
		</verse>
