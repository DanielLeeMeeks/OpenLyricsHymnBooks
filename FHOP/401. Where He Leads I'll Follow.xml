	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Sweet are the promises,
Kind is the word,
Dearer far than any message man ever heard;
Pure was the mind of Christ,
Sinless I see;
He the great example is, and pattern for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Where He leads I’ll follow,
Follow all the way.
Where He leads I’ll follow,
Follow Jesus ev’ry day.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Sweet is the tender love
Jesus hath shown,
Sweeter far than any love that mortals have known;
Kind to the erring one,
Faithful is He;
He the great example is, and pattern for me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>List to His loving words,
“Come unto Me;”
Weary, heavy-laden, there is sweet rest for thee;
Trust in His promises,
Faithful and sure;
Lean upon the Savior, and thy soul is secure. </lines>
		</verse>
