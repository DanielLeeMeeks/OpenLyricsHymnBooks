		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
Living with Jesus a new life divine;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Moment by moment I’m kept in His love;
Moment by moment I’ve life from above;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear,
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment, I’m under His care. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Never a heartache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop and never a moan;
Never a danger but there on the throne,
Moment by moment He thinks of His own. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still. </lines>
		</verse>
