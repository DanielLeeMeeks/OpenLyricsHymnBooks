		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Tho' the way we journey may be often drear,
We shall see the King some day;
On that blessèd morning clouds will disappear;
We shall see the King some day.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>We shall see the King some day,
We will shout and sing some day;
Gathered ’round the throne,
When He shall call His own,
We shall see the King some day.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>After pain and anguish, after toil and care,
We shall see the King some day;
Thro' the endless ages joy and blessing share,
We shall see the King some day. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>After foes are conquered, after battles won,
We shall see the King some day;
After strife is over, after set of sun,
We shall see the King some day. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>There with all the loved ones who have gone before,
We shall see the King some day;
Sorrow past forever, on that peaceful shore,
We shall see the King some day. </lines>
		</verse>
