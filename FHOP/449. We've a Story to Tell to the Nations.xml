		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>We've a story to tell to the nations
That shall turn their hearts to the right,
A story of truth and mercy,
A story of peace and light,
A story of peace and light.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>For the darkness shall turn to dawning,
And the dawning to noon-day bright,
And Christ's great kingdom shall come on earth,
The kingdom of love and light.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>We've a song to be sung to the nations
That shall lift their hearts to the Lord,
A song that shall conquer evil
And shatter the spear and sword,
And shatter the spear and sword. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>We've a message to give to the nations
That the Lord who reigneth above
Hath sent us His Son to save us,
And show us that God is love,
And show us that God is love. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>We've a Savior to show to the nations
Who the path of sorrow hath trod,
That all of the world's great peoples
Might come to the truth of God,
Might come to the truth of God. </lines>
		</verse>
