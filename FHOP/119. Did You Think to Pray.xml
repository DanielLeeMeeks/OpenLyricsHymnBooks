		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Ere you left your room this morning,
Did you think to pray?
In the name of Christ our Savior,
Did you sue for loving favor,
As a shield today?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Oh, how praying rests the weary!
Prayer will change the night to day;
So in sorrow and in gladness,
Don’t forget to pray.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>When you met with great temptation,
Did you think to pray?
By His dying love and merit,
Did you claim the Holy Spirit
As your guide and stay? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>When your heart was filled with anger,
Did you think to pray?
Did you plead for grace, my brother,
That you might forgive another
Who had crossed your way? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>When sore trials came upon you,
Did you think to pray?
When your soul was bowed in sorrow,
Balm of Gilead did you borrow
At the gates of day? </lines>
		</verse>
