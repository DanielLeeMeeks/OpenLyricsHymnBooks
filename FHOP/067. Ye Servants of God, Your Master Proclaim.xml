		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Ye servants of God, your Master proclaim,
And publish abroad His wonderful name;
The name all victorious of Jesus extol;
His kingdom is glorious, He rules over all.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>God ruleth on high, almighty to save;
And still He is nigh--His presence we have;
The great congregation His triumph shall sing,
Ascribing salvation to Jesus our King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>"Salvation to God, who sits on the throne,"
Let all cry aloud, and honor the Son;
The praises of Jesus the angels proclaim,
Fall down on their faces, and worship the Lamb.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Then let us adore, and give Him His right--
All glory and pow'r, all wisdom and might;
All honor and blessing, with angels above,
And thanks never ceasing, and infinite love.
Amen.</lines>
