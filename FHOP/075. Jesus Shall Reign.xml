		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom spread from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>From north to south the princes meet
To pay their homage at His feet;
While western empires own their Lord,
And savage tribes attend His word.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>To Him shall endless prayer be made,
And endless praises crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With ev'ry morning sacrifice.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>People and realms of ev'ry tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song,
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.</lines>
		</verse>
