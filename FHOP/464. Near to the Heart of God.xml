		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There is a place of quiet rest,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where sin cannot molest,
Near to the heart of God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>O Jesus, blest Redeemer
Sent from the heart of God,
Hold us, who wait before Thee
Near to the heart of God.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>There is a place of comfort sweet,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where we our Savior meet,
Near to the heart of God. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>There is a place of full releas,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where all is joy and peace,
Near to the heart of God. </lines>
