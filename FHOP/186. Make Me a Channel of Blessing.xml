		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is the love of God flowing thro' you?
Are you telling the lost of the Saviour?
Are you ready His service to do?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Make me a channel of blessing today,
Make me a channel of blessing, I pray;
My life possessing, my service blessing,
Make me a channel of blessing today.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Is your life a channel of blessing?
Are you burdened for those who are lost?
Have you urged upon those who are straying,
The Saviour who died on the cross? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is it daily telling for Him?
Have you spoken the Word of salvation
To those who are dying in sin? </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>We cannot be channels of blessing
If our lives are not free from known sin;
We will barriers be and a hindrance
To those we are trying to win. </lines>
		</verse>
