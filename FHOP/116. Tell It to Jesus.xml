			<lines>Are you weary, are you heavy-hearted?
Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus;
Are you grieving over joys departed?
Tell it to Jesus alone.</lines>
		</verse>

He is a friend that's well known;
You've no other such a friend or brother,
Tell it to Jesus alone.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Do the tears flow down your cheeks unbidden?
Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus;
Have you sins that to men's eyes are hidden?
Tell it to Jesus alone. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Do you fear the gath'ring clouds of sorrow?
Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus;
Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow?
Tell it to Jesus alone. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Are you troubled at the thought of dying?
Tell it to Jesus,
Tell it to Jesus;
For Christ's coming kingdom are you sighing?
Tell it to Jesus alone. </lines>
