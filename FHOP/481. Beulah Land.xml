		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I’ve reached the land of corn and wine,
And all its riches freely mine;
Here shines undimmed one blissful day,
For all my night has passed away.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>O Beulah Land, sweet Beulah Land,
As on thy highest mount I stand,
I look away across the sea,
Where mansions are prepared for me,
And view the shining glory shore,
My Heav’n, my home forevermore!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>My Savior comes and walks with me,
And sweet communion here have we;
He gently leads me by His hand,
For this is Heaven’s borderland. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>A sweet perfume upon the breeze
Is borne from ever-vernal trees;
And flow’rs, that never fading grow,
Where streams of life forever flow. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>The zephyrs seem to float to me,
Sweet sounds of Heaven’s melody,
As angels with the white-robed throng
Join in the sweet Redemption song. </lines>
		</verse>
