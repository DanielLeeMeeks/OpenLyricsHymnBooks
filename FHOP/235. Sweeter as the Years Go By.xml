		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Of Jesus’ love that sought me
When I was lost in sin;
Of wondrous grace that brought me
Back to His fold again;
Of heights and depths of mercy
Far deeper than the sea,
And higher than the heavens,
My theme shall ever be.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Sweeter as the years go by,
Sweeter as the years go by;
Richer, fuller, deeper,
Jesus’ love is sweeter,
Sweeter as the years go by.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He trod in old Judea
Life’s pathway long ago;
The people thronged about Him,
His saving grace to know;
He healed the broken-hearted
And caused the blind to see;
And still His great heart yearneth
In love for even me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>’Twas wondrous love which led Him
For us to suffer loss--
To bear without a murmur
The anguish of the cross;
With saints redeemed in glory,
Let us our voices raise,
Till heav’n and earth re-echo
With our Redeemer’s praise. </lines>
		</verse>
