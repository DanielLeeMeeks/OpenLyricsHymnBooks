		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Tell me the Old, Old Story,
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love;
Tell me the story simply,
As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary,
And helpless and defiled.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Tell me the Old, Old Story,
Tell me the Old, Old Story,
Tell me the Old, Old Story,
Of Jesus and His love.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Tell me the story slowly,
That I may take it in--
That wonderful redemption,
God's remedy for sin;
Tell me the story often,
For I forget so soon,
The "early dew" of morning
Has passed away at noon. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Tell me the story softly,
With earnest tones and grave;
Remember, I'm the sinner
Whom Jesus came to save;
Tell me the story always,
If you would really be,
In any time of trouble,
A comforter to me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Tell me the same old story,
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory
Is costing me too dear;
Yes, and when that world's glory
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell me the Old, Old Story:
"Christ Jesus makes thee whole." </lines>
		</verse>
