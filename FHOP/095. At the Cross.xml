		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Alas! And did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sov'reign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For sinners such as I?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart rolled away,
It was there by faith I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! grace unknown!
And love beyond degree! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut his glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man the creature's sin. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>But drops of grief can ne’er repay
The debt of love I owe:
Here, Lord, I give my self away,
’Tis all that I can do! </lines>
		</verse>
