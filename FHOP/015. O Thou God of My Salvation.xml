		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O Thou God of my salvation,
My Redeemer from all sin;
Moved by Thy divine compassion,
Who hast died my heart to win;
I will praise Thee, I will praise Thee,
Where shall I Thy praise begin?
I will praise Thee, I will praise Thee,
Where shall I Thy praise begin?</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Though unseen, I love the Savior,
He hath brought salvation near;
Manifests His pard'ning favor,
And when Jesus doth appear,
Soul and body, soul and body,
Shall His glorious image bear;
Soul and body, soul and body,
Shall His glorious image bear.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>While the angel choirs are crying,
“Glory to the great I Am,”
I with them will still be vying--
Glory, glory, to the Lamb!
Oh, how precious, oh, how precious
Is the sound of Jesus’ Name!
Oh, how precious, oh, how precious
Is the sound of Jesus’ Name!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Angels now are hov'ring round us,
Unperceived among the throng;
Wond'ring at the love that crowned us,
Glad to sing the holy song;
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Love and praise to Christ belong!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Love and praise to Christ belong!
Amen.</lines>
