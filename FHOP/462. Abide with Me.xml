		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Abide with me: fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide:
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see.
O Thou who changest not, abide with me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I need Thy presence ev'ry passing hour:
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's pow'r?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Thro' cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Hold Thou the cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies:
Heav'n's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee:
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!
Amen.</lines>
		</verse>
