And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.</lines>

With His blood He purchased me,
On the cross He sealed my pardon,
Paid the debt, and made me free.</lines>

How my lost estate to save,
In his boundless love and mercy,

Over sin, and death, and hell. </lines>
