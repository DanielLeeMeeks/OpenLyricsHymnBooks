		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I have a song I love to sing,
Since I have been redeemed,
Of my Redeemer, Savior, King,
Since I have been redeemed.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Since I have been redeemed,
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory in His name;
Since I have been redeemed,
I will glory in my Savior's name.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I have a Christ that satisfies,
Since I have been redeemed,
To do His will my highest prize,
Since I have been redeemed. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I have a witness bright and clean,
Since I have been redeemed,
Dispelling every doubt and fear,
Since I have been redeemed. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>I have a home prepared for me,
Since I have been redeemed,
Where I shall dwell eternally,
Since I have been redeemed. </lines>
