		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There's a land that is fairer than day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>To our bountiful Father above,
We will offer the tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our days. </lines>
		</verse>
