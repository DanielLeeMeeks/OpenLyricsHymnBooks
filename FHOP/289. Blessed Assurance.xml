		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long;
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Savior am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love. </lines>
		</verse>
