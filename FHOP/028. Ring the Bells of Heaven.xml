		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy today
For a soul returning from the wild;
See! the Father meets him out upon the way,
Welcoming His weary, wand'ring child.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Glory! glory! how the angels sing;
Glory! glory! how the loud harps ring!
'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea,
Pealing forth the anthem of the free!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Ring the bells of heaven! there is joy today,
For the wand'rer now is reconciled;
Yes, a soul is rescued from his sinful way,
And is born anew a ransomed child. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Ring the bells of heaven! spread the feast today!
Angels, swell the glad triumphant strain!
Tell the joyful tidings, bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again. </lines>
		</verse>
