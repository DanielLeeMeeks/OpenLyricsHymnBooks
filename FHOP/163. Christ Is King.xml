		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Come, friends sing, of the faith that’s so dear to me,
Revealed thro’ God’s Son, in Galilee;
He brought peace on earth and good will to the sons of men,
Go tell it to the world, her King reigns again.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I am so happy in Jesus,
Captivity’s Captor is He;
Angels rejoice when a soul’s saved,
Some day we like Him shall be,
Sorrow and joy have the same Lord,
Valley of shadows shall sing;
Death has its life, its door opens in heaven eternally,
Christ is King.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Crucified, thus He suffered and bled for me,
Death and the grave won sin’s victory;
Then the sky grew dark and the temple veil rent in twain,
Rocks rent, and angels came, for He lived again. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>At His feet, on old Olivet’s Hill, they say,
Cloud chariots halted, took Christ away;
Then the angels came and to wond’ring disciples said
He’ll come, and earth and sea shall yield up their dead. </lines>
		</verse>
