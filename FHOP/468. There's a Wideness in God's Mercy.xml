		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,
Like the wideness of the sea;
There’s a kindness in His justice
Which is more than liberty.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>There is welcome for the sinner,
And more graces for the good;
There is mercy with the Savior;
There is healing in His blood.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>For the love of God is broader,
Than the measures of man's mind;
And the heart of the Eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>If our love were but more simple,
We should take Him at His word,
And our lives would be all sunshine
In the sweetness of our Lord.</lines>
		</verse>
