		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,
Most beautiful, most bright;
On thee, the high and lowly,
Bending before the throne,
Sing, Holy, Holy, Holy,
To the great Three in One.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>On thee, at the creation,
The light first had its birth;
On thee, for our salvation,
Christ rose from depths of earth;
On thee our Lord, victorious
The Spirit sent from Heav'n;
And thus on thee most glorious,
A triple light was given.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Today on weary nations
The heav'nly manna falls;
To holy convocations
The silver trumpet calls,
Where gospel light is glowing
With pure and radiant beams,
And living water flowing
With soul-refreshing streams.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>New graces ever gaining
From this our day of rest,
We reach the rest remaining
To spirits of the blest.
To Holy Ghost be praises,
To Father and to Son;
The Church her voice upraises
To thee, blest Three in One.
Amen.</lines>
