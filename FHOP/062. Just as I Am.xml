		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Just as I am, without one plea
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bidd'st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come! I come!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot,
To Thee, whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come! I come!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Just as I am, tho' tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt,
Fightings and fears within, without,
O Lamb of God, I come! I come!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
Yea, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come! I come!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come! I come!</lines>
		</verse>
