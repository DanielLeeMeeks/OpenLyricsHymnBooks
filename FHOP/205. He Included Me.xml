		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I am so happy in Christ today,
That I go singing along my way;
Yes, I'm so happy to know and say,
"Jesus included me, too."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Jesus included me,
Yes, He included me,
When the Lord said, "Whosoever,"
He included me;
Jesus included me,
Yes, He included me,
When the Lord said, "Whoseoever,"
He included me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Gladly I read, "Whoseoever may
Come to the fountain of life today;"
But when I read it I always say,
"Jesus included me, too." </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Ever God's Spirit is saying, "Come!"
Hear the Bride saying, "No longer roam;"
But I am sure while they're calling home,
Jesus included me, too. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>"Freely come drink," words the soul to thrill!
O with what joy they my heart do fill!
For when He said, "Whosoever will,"
Jesus included me, too. 
Amen.</lines>
