		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Work, for the night is coming,
Work thro' the morning hours;
Work while the dew is sparkling;
Work, 'mid springing flow'rs.
Work, when the day grows brighter,
Work in the glowing sun;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man's work is done.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Work for the night is coming,
Work thro' the sunny noon;
Fill brightest hours with labor,
Rest comes sure and soon.
Give ev'ry flying minute
Something to keep in store;
Work, for the night is coming,
When man works no more.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Work for the night is coming,
Under the sunset skies;
While their bright tints are glowing,
Work, for daylight flies.
Work till the last beam fadeth,
Fadeth to shine no more;
Work, while the night is dark'ning,
When man's work is o'er.</lines>
		</verse>
