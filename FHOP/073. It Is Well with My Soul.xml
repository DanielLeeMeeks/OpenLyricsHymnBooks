		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say,
"It is well, it is well, with my soul."</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Though Satan should buffet, tho' trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>My sin--oh, the bliss of this glorious tho't--
My sin--not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend,
"Even so"--it is well with my soul. </lines>
		</verse>
