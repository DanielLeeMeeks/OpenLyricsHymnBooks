		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I was once a sinner, but I came
Pardon to receive from my Lord:
This was freely given, and I found
That He always kept His word.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>There’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
And the white-robed angels sing the story,
“A sinner has come home.”
For there’s a new name written down in glory,
And it’s mine, O yes, it’s mine!
With my sins forgiven I am bound for heaven,
Never more to roam.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I was humbly kneeling at the cross,
Fearing naught but God’s angry frown;
When the heavens opened and I saw
That my name was written down. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>In the Book ’tis written, “Saved by Grace,”
O the joy that came to my soul!
Now I am forgiven, and I know
By the blood I am made whole. </lines>
		</verse>
