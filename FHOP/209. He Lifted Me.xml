		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>In lovingkindness Jesus came
My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
Thro' grace He lifted me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>From sinking sand He lifted me,
With tender hand He lifted me,
From shades of night to plains of light,
Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He called me long before I heard,
Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His word,
Forgiv'n He lifted me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
In love He lifted me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Now on a higher plane I dwell,
And with my soul I know 'tis well;
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
He should have lifted me. </lines>
		</verse>
