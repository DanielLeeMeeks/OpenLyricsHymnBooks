		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When we walk with the Lord
In the Light of His Word
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Trust and obey, for there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blessed if we trust and obey. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go,--
Never fear, only trust and obey. 
Amen.</lines>
