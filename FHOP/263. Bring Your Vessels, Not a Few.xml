		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Are you looking for the fullness of the blessing of the Lord
In your heart and life today?
Claim the promise of your Father, come according to His word,
In the blessed old-time way.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>He will fill your heart today to overflowing,
As the Lord commandeth you,
"Bring your vessels, not a few;"
He will fill your heart today to overflowing
With the Holy Ghost and pow'r.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Bring your empty earthen vessels, clean thro' Jesus' precious blood,
Come, ye needy, one and all;
And in human consecration wait before the throne of God,
'Till the Holy Ghost shall fall. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Like the cruse of oil unfailing is His grace forevermore,
And His love unchanging still;
And according to His promise with the Holy Ghost and pow'r,
He will ev'ry vessel fill. </lines>
		</verse>
