	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>There’s within my heart a melody
Jesus whispers sweet and low,
Fear not, I am with thee, peace, be still,
In all of life’s ebb and flow.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Jesus, Jesus, Jesus--
Sweetest name I know,
Fills my ev'ry longing,
Keeps me singing as I go.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>All my life was wrecked by sin and strife,
Discord filled my heart with pain,
Jesus swept across the broken strings,
Stirred the slumb’ring chords again. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Feasting on the riches of His grace,
Resting ’neath His sheltering wing,
Always looking on His smiling face,
That is why I shout and sing. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Tho' sometimes He leads thro' waters deep,
Trials fall across the way,
Tho' sometimes the path seems rough and steep,
See His footprints all the way. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Soon He’s coming back to welcome me
Far beyond the starry sky;
I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown,
I shall reign with Him on high. 
Amen.</lines>
		</verse>
