		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>When He cometh, when He cometh
To make up His jewels,
All His jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own:</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Like the stars of the morning,
His bright crown adorning,
They shall shine in their beauty,
Bright gems for His crown.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He will gather, He will gather
The gems for His kingdom,
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,
His loved and His own: </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Little children, little children
Who love their Redeemer,
Are the jewels, precious jewels,
His loved and His own: </lines>
		</verse>
