	<lyrics>
		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I come to the garden alone,
While the dew is still on the roses,
And the voice I hear,
Falling on my ear,
The Son of God discloses.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>And He walks with me, and He talks with me,
And He tells me I am His own;
And the joy we share as we tarry there,
None other has ever known.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He speaks, and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,
And the melody
That He gave to me,
Within my heart is ringing. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I’d stay in the garden with Him
Tho' the night around me be falling,
But He bids me go;
Through the voice of woe
His voice to me is calling. </lines>
		</verse>
