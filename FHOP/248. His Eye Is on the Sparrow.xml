		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Why should I feel discouraged,
Why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for Heav’n and home,
When Jesus is my portion?
My constant Friend is He:
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I sing because I’m happy,
I sing because I’m free,
For His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>“Let not your heart be troubled,”
His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness,
I lose my doubts and fears;
Tho' by the path He leadeth,
But one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Whenever I am tempted,
Whenever clouds arise,
When songs give place to sighing,
When hope within me dies,
I draw the closer to Him,
From care He sets me free;
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow,
And I know He watches me. </lines>
