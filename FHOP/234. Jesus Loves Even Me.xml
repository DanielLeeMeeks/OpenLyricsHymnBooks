		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I am so glad that our Father in heav'n,
Tells of His love in the Book He has giv'n;
Wonderful things in the Bible I see;
This is the dearest--that Jesus loves me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
Jesus loves even me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Though I forget Him and wander away,
Kindly He follows wherever I stray;
Back to His dear loving arms would I flee,
When I remember that Jesus loves me. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,
When in His beauty I see the Great King,
This shall my song in eternity be,
"Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!" </lines>
		</verse>
