		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Wounded for me, wounded for me,
There on the cross He was wounded for me;
Gone my transgressions, and now I am free,
All because Jesus was wounded for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Dying for me, dying for me,
There on the cross He was dying for me;
Now in His death my redemption I see,
All because Jesus was dying for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Risen for me, risen for me,
Up from the grave He has risen for me;
Now evermore from death’s sting I am free,
All because Jesus has risen for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Living for me, living for me,
Up in the skies He is living for me;
Daily He’s pleading and praying for me,
All because Jesus is living for me.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Coming for me, coming for me,
One day to earth He is coming for me;
Then with what joy His dear face I shall see,
O how I praise Him! He’s coming for me.</lines>
		</verse>
