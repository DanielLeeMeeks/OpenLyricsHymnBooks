		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I saw One hanging on a tree,
In agony and blood;
He fixed His loving eyes on me,
As near His cross I stood.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Oh, can it be, upon a tree
The Savior died for me?
My soul is thrilled,
My heart is filled,
To think He died for me!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Sure, never to my latest breath,
Can I forget that look;
It seemed to charge me with His death,
Though not a word He spoke. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>My conscience felt and owned the guilt,
And plunged me in despair:
I saw my sins His blood had spilt
And helped to nail Him there. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Alas! I knew not what I did,
But now my tears are vain:
Where shall my trembling soul be hid?
For I the Lord have slain. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>A second look He gave, which said,
“I freely all forgive;
This blood is for thy ransom paid,
I die that thou may'st live.” </lines>
		</verse>
