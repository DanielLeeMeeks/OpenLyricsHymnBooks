		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Christ Jesus my Lord from heaven came,
To save me from guilt and sin and shame;
His death on the cross of Calvary
Brought pardon and gave me liberty.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I love Him because He first loved me,
He first loved me, He first loved me;
I love Him because He first loved me,
And died on the cross of Calvary.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>He sweat drops of blood in prayer for me,
Heartbroken in dark Gethsemane.,
While angels from blessèd realms of light
Gave strength to His aching heart that night. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Up Calvary’s hill the cross He bore,
And for me a crown of thorns He wore;
They nailed Him upon the tree to die,
Then darkness came over earth and sky. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>My Lord who was slain by sinful man,
A wonderful Friend to me has been;
He rose from the tomb with victory,
And now I love Him who first loved me. </lines>
		</verse>
