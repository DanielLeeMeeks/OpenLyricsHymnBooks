		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Tho' the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, and I am His child.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Under His wings, under His wings,
Who from His love can sever?
Under His wings my soul shall abide,
Safely abide forever.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly turns to His rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
There I find comfort and there I am blessed. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Under His wings, O what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till life’s trials are o’er;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me,
Resting in Jesus I’m safe evermore. </lines>
		</verse>
