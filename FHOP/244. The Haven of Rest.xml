		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>My soul in sad exile was out on life’s sea,
So burdened with sin and distrest,
Till I heard a sweet voice saying, “Make me your choice;”
And I entered the “Haven of Rest!”</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>I’ve anchored my soul in the “Haven of Rest,”
I’ll sail the wide seas no more;
The tempest may sweep over wild, stormy deep,
In Jesus I’m safe evermore.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I yielded myself to His tender embrace,
And faith taking hold of the Word,
My fetters fell off, and I anchored my soul;
The “Haven of Rest” is my Lord. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>The song of my soul, since the Lord made me whole,
Has been the old story so blest,
Of Jesus, who’ll save whosoever will have
A home in the “Haven of Rest!” </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>How precious the thought that we all may recline,
Like John the beloved so blest,
On Jesus’ strong arm, where no tempest can harm--
Secure in the “Haven of Rest!” </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v5">
			<lines>Oh, come to the Savior, He patiently waits
To save by His power divine;
Come, anchor your soul in the “Haven of Rest,”
And say, “My Beloved is mine.” </lines>
		</verse>
