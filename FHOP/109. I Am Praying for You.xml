		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>I have a Savior, He’s pleading in glory,
A dear, loving Savior, tho' earth-friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o’er me,
But oh, that my Savior were your Savior, too!</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
For you I am praying,
I’m praying for you.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>I have a Father; to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven,
But oh, that He’d let me bring you with me, too! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>I have a robe; 'tis resplendent in whiteness,
Awaiting in glory my wondering view;
Oh, when I receive it all shining in brightness,
Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too! </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>When Jesus has found you, tell others the story,
That my loving Savior is your Savior, too;
Then pray that your Savior will bring them to glory,
And prayer will be answered--'twas answered for you! </lines>
		</verse>
