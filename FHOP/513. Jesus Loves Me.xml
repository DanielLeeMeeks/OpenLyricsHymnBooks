		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Jesus loves me! this I know,
For the Bible tells me so;
Little ones to Him belong,
They are weak, but He is strong.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
Yes, Jesus loves me!
The Bible tells me so.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Jesus loves me! loves me still,
Tho' I'm very weak and ill;
That I might from sin be free,
Bled and died upon the tree. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>Jesus loves me! He who died
Heaven's gate to open wide;
He will wash away my sin,
Let His little child come in. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v4">
			<lines>Jesus loves me! He will stay
Close beside me all the way:
Thou hast bled and died for me,
I will henceforth live for Thee. </lines>
		</verse>
