		<verse name="v1">
			<lines>Yield not to temptation,
For yielding is sin,
Each vict’ry will help you
Some other to win;
Fight manfully onward,
Dark passions subdue,
Look ever to Jesus,
He will carry you through.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="c">
		<lines>Ask the Savior to help you,
Comfort, strengthen, and keep you,
He is willing to aid you,
He will carry you through.</lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v2">
			<lines>Shun evil companions,
Bad language disdain,
God’s name hold in rev’rence,
Nor take it in vain;
Be thoughtful and earnest,
Kindhearted and true,
Look ever to Jesus,
He will carry you through. </lines>
		</verse>
		<verse name="v3">
			<lines>To him that o’ercometh
God giveth a crown,
Thro' faith we will conquer,
Though often cast down;
He, who is our Savior,
Our strength will renew,
Look ever to Jesus,
He will carry you through. </lines>
